<h1>Banners</h1>
<p>I recently created a spiffy banner that users of the library can
display on their page.</p>
<img src='powerby.jpg'>
<p>We'd appreciate it if everyone who uses the library places our
banner on their site, along with a link to the phppdflib home
page (http://www.potentialtech.com/ppl.php).</p>
