  Users can now choose their preferred language and theme on the
  login-screen.

- Split of language file
  inc.Language.php has been splitted so that every language is
  provided in its own file.

- Added ADOdb
  Due to ADOdb MyDMS is no longer limited to MySQL. Every database
  that is supported by ADOdb can be used together with MyDMS

- Admin-Tool: Overview of folders and documents
  A tool that shows a list of all folders and documents together 
  with the ACLs has been added. The section "admin-tools" will
  become bigger in the next versions (import files etc).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in Version 1.3.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- New feature: Auto-Conversion to HTML
  When uploading files they are now converted to HTML automatically.
  So you can now even view Winword-files online with your favourite
  browser.

- Integrated themes
  Themes (again: thanks to Marcel van Groenigen), which were only
  available by a seperate download so far, are now fully integrated
  into MyDMS.
  I'm looking forward to MacOS X Themes :-)

- Fixed bug: Search function
  An error occured if no folder had been chosen. This has been fixed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in Version 1.2.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Improved searching functionality
  MyDMS now offers you a lot more options to help you find exactly
  what you were looking for.
  This is only the first stop of improvement: Look forward to an
  even more powerful search engine in the next versions :-)

- Security-Bug: Session-ID
  One could guess the session-id very easily, since it was only a
  two digit number. This has been corrected so that it should now
  be impossible to get illegal access this way.
  Tip: Empty tblSessions once a day (by a cron-job for example).


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in Version 1.2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Move documents and folders
  If you have put folders or documents to the wrong place or just
  want to re-organize the structure you can now easily move
  documents and folders.

- New languages
  A Russian (thanks to Dmitri) and a Durch version (thanks to André
  Koot) are now available, too.

- Upload-Bug
  With certain configurations moving the temporary file of on upload
  caused problems. MyDMS now uses the built-in move_uploaded_file()
  function to prevent this error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Changes in Version 1.1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Sequence of Documents and Folders
  One of the most wanted features has been realized: The user has
  now full control of the sequence in which documents and folders
  appear in the system.

- Related Documents
  Every documents now has a list of link to related documents.
  There are two kinds of links: public and private ones; public
  links can be seen by anyone, while private ones are only visible
  to the user that created them.
  Users with read-only access can only add private links, while
  users with at least read-write access can decide which type of
  link they want to add.
  Private links can only be deleted by the user that has created
  them while public links - no matter who created them - can be
  deleted by all users with read-write access.

- Fixed Bug: Delete documents
  When deleting documents they were removed only from the database.
  The files in the content-directory were kept.

- Fixed Bug: View and download documents.
  Very ling filenames (more than 70 characters) caused problems
  with viewing and downloading of documents. By runnning the
  db-update filenames with up to 150 characters are now possible.

- Spanish translation
  Eugenio Ramajo has completely translated MyDMS to Spanish

- Disable guest-login
  You can now disable the guest-login introduced in Version 1.1.0
  by setting $_enableGuestLogin to false.

- Confirmation for deletion
  When deleting documents or folders you now have to confirm this
  action to prevent you from accidentaly deleting important data.

- Security improved
  By manually changing the folder-ID in the URL it was possible to
  "illegaly" show folders or documents (but downloading or viewing
  the actual content was not possible).


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Changes in Version 1.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Guest-Login
  You can now choose to log-in as guest so that you can access your
  documents more quickly. The guest user cannot be added to the ACLs.
  So take care that the default access is at least "read" if you wish
  to have access with the guest-user.
  You cannot edit the guest-users's account.

- Download documents more quickly
  If you want to download the current version (or view it online) there
  is no more need to scroll to the end of the document's page: Now there
  is a button just on top of the site for downloading the current version.

- Icons for Mime-Types
  According to the document's MIME-type an additional icon is show.
  (Icons from KDE3).

- Correct filename when downloading
  When downloading a file it was named data.[extension] up to know. This has
  been replaced by the original filename.

- if you had the GNU test-package installed on your machine, the function

  function.
