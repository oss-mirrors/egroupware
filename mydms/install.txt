              MyDMS 1.4.3 Installation Instruction
-------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Requirements

Make sure you have PHP 4.0 or higher installed (when using PHP 4.2
you need to set "register_globals" to "on" in your php.ini). MyDMS
will work with PHP running in CGI-mode as well as running as module
under apache.
If you want to give your users the opportunity of uploading passport
photos you have to enable the gd-library (but the rest of MyDMS will
work without gd, too).


2. Installation & Configuration

Unzip the downloaded file (mydms-1.4.3.zip) in a directory that is
accessible via your web server.

You will also need to create a directory where the uploaded files
are stored. This directory should not be accessible via your
web-server for security reasons (create it outside of your www-root
directory or put an appropriate .htaccess file in it).

Next you should set up your Database. Use the included script
create_tables.sql. Since the exact procedure differs on the
differend database-systems I cannot give you a detailed instruction
here. Post any questions concering this problem to the MyDMS-Forum.

Now edit inc.Settings.php.
Open that file (it is located in the "inc"-directory) and set the
variables to the correct values (you will find a short description
for each variable in the file itself).

TIP: You can find out your root-directory by placing th following
line into a php-file: <? phpInfo(); ?>
Open it with your browser and look for "DOCUMENT_ROOT".

When running into problems with the db-settings read the readme-file
in the adodb-directory or post questions to the MyDMS-Forum.

By default PHP allows only files to be uploaded that are up to 2Mb
in size. You can change this limit by editing php.ini: Search for
"upload_max_filesize" and set it to the appropriate value (you
should also change the value for "post_max_size" and make sure that
your web-server does not limit the size either).


3. Install additional languages and themes

Since version 1.3.1 you have to install additional languages (only
german and English are included) manually. You can download language
files from dms.markuswestpahl.de/download.html. Unzip the downloaded
file in the langauges-dicrectory.
The same applies to themes (you have to unzip the downloaded fiels to
the themes-directory, of course).


4. Email Notification

MyDMS allows notification of users via email on new/updated or
expired documents. Installing this feature is a little bit more
tricky. You need to change the working directory to the
"op-directory" and then run the php-executable followed by
"op.NotifyMailer.php". This should be done daily. Of course you
need not do that by hand: Under Linux use the cron-daemon and
under windows the "Scheduled Tasks" in the system configuration.
Refer to the corresponding man-pages or the windows help (a sample
script (runNotifyMailer.bat) for windows is included).


5. Additional Mime-types

Each Mime-Type is represented by an icon. You can add additional
Mime-Types by placing an image-file in out/images/icons an adding
an entry to the $icons array at the end of file inc/inc.OutUitls.php
(only for users with PHP experience).


6. Auto-conversion to HTML

Version 1.3.0 introduces a new feature: Documents can automatically be
converted to HTML when uploading.
You can enable this feature by setting $_enableConverting (in 
inc.Settings.php) to true.
You will also need to edit $_convertFileTypes (again in 
inc.Settings.php). This array defines which file-types are converted
and how.
Under windows Word-, Excel- and Powerpoint-Files are automatically
converted using js-Scipts and MS-Office. I tested it with Office 2000
and it worked just fine.
Under Linux mswordview is used to convert Word-Files by default.
Warning: Getting this feature working can be very tricky but if it
works it is a great enhancement I think.
Especially IIS could cause problems with its IIS-Guest-Account not
having enough rights to execute Word or Excel...
You will also have to edit your httpd.conf to be able to view the converted
files online. Load mod_rewrite and add to following lines to your conf:

  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.*)viewonline/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/(.+)$
  RewriteRule (.*)viewonline/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/(.+)$ $1op.ViewOnline.php?request=$2:$3 [PT]

IIS Users can download the IIS Rewrite Engine for example:

Post any questions to the MyDMS forum, please.



7. Nearly finished
 
Now point your browser to http://your.server.com/mydms/index.php
and login with “admin” both as username and password.
After having logged in you should first choose "My Account" and
change the Administrator's password and email-address.
