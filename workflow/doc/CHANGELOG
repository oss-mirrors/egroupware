	Next ones will only be compatible with series > 1.0.1 (1.2 release)
	Note that with 1.0.0.009 you could experiment several problems:
		* tables updates are not always done well
		* with MySQL you should set your tables to Innodb type and get the adoDB from the 1.0.1 phpgwapi
		or the 1.2 release and update some lines in egw.db class. All this to
		support mylst ADOdb type with transactions and locks
	Note as well this version is not securized with egroupware SQL checks,
	you should not use it as a stable web-open application

Before this lot of work has been done by Alejandro Pedraza and Michael
Bartz. Prior to this there was as well a lot of work done on the original
Galaxia engine, see http://tikiwiki.org/tiki-index.php?page=GalaxiaWorkflow
 with contributors like Marc Laporte and others, gatto look at the sources
Prior to this they was work done on Openflow (http://www.openflow.it)
