These instructions assume that you have a working install of:
        a. A web server (Apache, IIS, etc).
        b. PHP (with LDAP support)

* Installing phpLDAPadmin in 4 easy steps:

  1. Untar the archive (if you're reading this, you already did that).
  2. Put the resulting 'phpldapadmin' directory somewhere in your webroot.
  3. Copy 'config.php.example' to 'config.php' and edit to taste.
  4. Then, point your browser to the phpldapadmin directory.

* Browser Notes

  phpLDAPadmin was developed on Mozilla, and will most likely run best thereon.
  However, testing has been done on Internet Explorer, and it should work
  well also. No testing has been done on either Konqueror (or any khtml-based
  browser like Safari) or Opera. If you find a browser incompatibility,
  please report it.
