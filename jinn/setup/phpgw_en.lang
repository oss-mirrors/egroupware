jinn-description	common	en	JiNN is a recursive acronime meaning 'JiNN is Not Nuke' because the main author doesn't like the Nuke-method to create a Content Management System. With JiNN you can build your own CMS's completely adapted to your database-structure and webdesign. For configuring user input forms we make use of plugins to show/process the field data. For more information please visit: <a href='http://www.egroupware.org/jinn-webpage'>www.egroupware.org/jinn-webpage</a>. <p>Here's our <a href="jinn/CHANGELOG" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
