Q: I'm composing mail, what do I put in the "To" and/or "CC" boxes
A: The easiest was is to follow these examples,
   pay close attention to the spaces, do not add spaces you do not see here:
johndoe@example.com
johndoe@example.com,jane@example.com,tarzan@example.com
"John Doe" <johndoe@example.com>
"John Doe" <johndoe@example.com>,"Jane" <jane@example.com>
johndoe@example.com,"Jane" <jane@example.com>,tarzan@example.com


Q: I use UWash IMAP, where will phpgroupware email look for MBOX files?
A: The mbox folder "INBOX" will always be available
If your other mbox folders like "Sent" and "Trash" are in your $HOME directory, then you DO NOT need any special config.
If your mbox files are in $HOME/mail  then you must do this:
 - goto the "Preferences" page
 - click on "E-Mail preferences"
 - check "use custom settings"
 - enter your email account name, password, and your email address
 - enter the name or IP address of your IMAP server (ex: mail.example.com)
 - choose IMAP as your "mail server type"
 - choose "UWash" as your "imap server type"
(note that all this information up to this point should be no surprise to you)
 - the last option is presently called "Mail Folder(uw-maildir)"
it is somewhat mis-named because it also works for regular UWash IMAP too.
 - If your mbox files are in $HOME   then LEAVE THIS OPTION BLANK.
 - If your mbox files are in $HOME/mail  then type in this:
mail
(notice NO QUOTES, NO TILDES, NO SLASHES)
 - If your mbox files are in $HOME/mystuff  then type in this:
mystuff
(notice NO QUOTES, NO TILDES, NO SLASHES)
 - If your mbox files are in $HOME/data/email  then type in this:
data/email
(notice NO QUOTES, NO TILDES, and you see the slash in the middle)
 - In the rare event you need to use a slash as seen above, then of course, forward slash is used in Linux type systems, and backslash typically for M-S installations.

 - then click "Submit"
Note: As of this writting, it is a "per user" config option only


Q: I can not attach files to an email, I get errors about "unlink".
A: There are 2 directories to check:
 - goto /setup  (the phpgroupware initial setup page)
 - login to "Setup/Config Admin Log"
 - in "Step 2 - Configuration" click "Edit Current Configuration"
 - under "Path Information" see the box labeled
   "Enter full path for temporary files: Examples: /tmp, C:\TEMP"
 - what you entered in this box will be the first place to look
   on Linux systems, say you enter this
/var/phpgw
  then that directory *could* be (user.group perms) webserver.webserver 0700. I say *could* because the exact security configuration is beyond
the scope of this FAQ. What is needed is that the directory you 
enter in that box should exist and have permissions that allow the 
web server to read and write files and create directories.

 - The other directory to check is the temporary directory
  that your web server typically uses, but the information listed
  above is by far the most common config issue with email attachments.
