<p class=label>Introduction</p>
<p>vbXMLRPC.dll provides a COM implementation of a client interface to web services implementing the XML-RPC standard. The DLL is designed to be as light an implementation as possible with as few references to other DLLs as practical to reduce problems with program dependencies.</p>

<p class=label>Dependencies</p>
<p>vbXMLRPC.dll has the following dependencies: VB6STKIT.DLL, COMCAT.DLL, STDOLE2.TLB, ASYCFILT.DLL, OLEPRO32.DLL, OLEAUT32.DLL, MSVBVM60.DLL and WININET.DLL</p>

<p>All files with the exception of WinInet.dll are standard files that come with every installation of a Visual Basic App. If you have a Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications installation (very likely) they will be present on your machine. WinInet.dll is shipped with Internet Explorer since version 3 so you are likely to have this DLL also.</p>

<p>If you have any problems with dependencies, vbXMLRPC.dll was compiled with Visual Basic 6.0 (SP5) against the following versions of these DLLs.</p>
<ul>
<li>VB6STKIT.DLL 6.0.84.50</li>
<li>COMCAT.DLL 4.71.1460.1</li>
<li>STDOLE2.TLB 2.40.4275.1</li>
<li>ASYCFILT.DLL 2.40.4275.1</li>
<li>OLEPRO32.DLL 5.0.4275.1</li>
<li>OLEAUT32.DLL 2.40.4275.1</li>
<li>MSVBVM60.DLL 6.0.89.64</li>
<li>WININET.DLL 5.50.4915.500</li>
<li>vbXML.DLL 0.5.0020</li>
</ul>

<p class=label>Change History</p>

<p>Version 0.9.0033 - Status Beta - 15th May, 2004</p>

<li>Performance has improved significantly due to changes in <a href="http://www.enappsys.com/backend/vbXML_Index.jsp">vbXML.dll</a>.</li>
<li>Modified the XMLRPCRequest.HostPort property to a Long so it can except the full range of port numbers after a sugestion by Torsten Fackert.</li>
<li>Added support for HTTP basic authentication using code donated by Chris Carter. Added new properties to XMLRPCRequest called Username and Password.</li>
</ul>

<p>Version 0.9.0030 - Status Beta - 14th February, 2003</p>

<li>After Assistance from Rick at <a href="http://www.techno-weenie.com/">www.techno-weenie.com</a> SSL suupport problems have been bottomed.</li>
<li>SSL only works on port 443, features of wininet.dll will not allow other ports.</li>
<li>The "Secure" parameter of the XMLRPCRequest.Submit method has been removed.</li>
<li>A new property "SSLFlags" has been added to the XMLRPCRequest object.</li>
<li>A new enum "XMLRPC_SSLTypes" has been added.</li>

<li>The AddBase64 methods in XMLRPCArray, XMLRPCParams, XMLRPCStruct and the Base64 property in XMLRPCValue have been changed to take an XMLRPCBase64 object as opposed to a string.</li>
<li>Count methods in XMLRPCArray, XMLRPCParams and XMLRPCStruct classes have been changed to properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>Version 0.5.0011 - Status Alpha - 24th September, 2002</p>

<li>XMLRPCArray.AddInteger(), XMLRPCParams.AddInteger() and XMLRPCStruct.AddInteger() have been changed to require a VB <b>Long</b> integer (32 bit signed integer) instead of a VB <b>Integer</b> integer (16 bit signed integer).
