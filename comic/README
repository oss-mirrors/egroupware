This application is inspired by phpcomic.

However, proxy servers that are .pac configured
do not allow direct http requests. 
They, therefore, do not allow snarfing of 
image or html data and cannot perform  the
"connect and parse" of phpcomic.  So, either
those comics need flagged that they cannot
be resolved or I opt for some flat parsing rules
that precludes some comics.  I am going to attempt
the latter.

For the same reason as above, comics can either
be static or snarfed.  Static is simply a fully
qualified url to the host site that inlines the
graphic.  Snarfed will download the graphic to
the image directory and set the date in the
comic data table.  I, also, plan to allow
(at least snarfed images) to be scaled.

Why snarf?  If your phpgw site runs on https,
then static images will be broken (external
links to otherwise unsecure sites).  The 
"work around" for this is snarfing.

If you run secure behind a .pac configured
proxy server, then it sucks being you.

TODO:

01) admin hook
02) tweak out parsing functions
03) generate data from phpcomic and netcomics
04) about hook
05) front page hook
06) consider a mixed mode of static and
    snarfed (or a by image basis)
