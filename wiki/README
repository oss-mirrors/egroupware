Axis Wiki README
----------------

AxisWiki is a modified version of WikkiTikkiTavi for use with phpGroupware.
See CHANGES file for a list of differences between AxisWiki and Tavi. 
Modifications are either cosmetic or functional so you may use Tavi and AxisWiki
interchangably. So, right now if you want to use it outside phpgw then use Tavi.

see http://tavi.sf.net for information on Tavi.
