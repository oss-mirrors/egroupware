These are quick and simple instructions on how to install and use this app.  The more in depth
ones will follow soon.

First, use setup3 to create your tables.

Next, you will need to create an anonymous account.  Do this by creating a normal user account
with just permissions to the registration app.

Create a group called 'users', this will be the default group that all users belong to.
So, you can give and take permissions to an entire group, instead of every single user.

In main.php, there is a config section towards the top.
	$domain         - Which domain to user out of the header.inc.php file, most will use default
	$template_set   - Template set to use, this allows site to create there own layout
	$anonymous_user - anonymous user loginid
	$anonymous_pass - (guess :)
