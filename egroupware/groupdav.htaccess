# EGroupware CalDav or CardDAV support for Apple apps (incl. iPhone)
#
# $Id$
#
# This file can be copyied as .htaccess to your document root
# to support Mac or iPhone clients to autodetec CalDAV and CardDAV
# (currently Addressbook does NOT allow to specify our groupdav.php 
#  URL manually).
#
# As alternative an EGroupware install directly in the docroot or
# an unconditional redirect from the docroot to EGroupware's index.php 
# will archive the same thing, as it redirects PROPFIND or OPTION 
# requests to groupdav.php/ (many have such a redirect already in place).
#
# iCal app does NOT allow multiple redirects, therefore it must be redirected
# directly to groupdav.php/ eg. by the following index.php in the docroot:
#
# <?php
# if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'PROPFIND' || $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'OPTIONS')
# {
#     header("Location: /egroupware/groupdav.php/\n\n");
# }
# else
# {
# 	  header("Location: /egroupware/\n\n");
# }
# exit;
#
# An other alternativ is to copy the above PROPFIND/OPTIONS redirect 
# into your index.php in the docroot.
#
# Please note: 
# - your Apache web server needs to be setup to read .htaccess files and 
#   allow use of the RewriteEngine directive (AllowOverride FileInfo). 
# - you need to replace /egroupware with your EGroupware URL path eg. /egw
