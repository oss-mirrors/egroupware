This version is our first beta version.  This means that the API is now stable enough to use for add on apps.
There will be bugs, but the structure should change very much from this point on.

This version contains a great deal of database changes.  We applogize for so many changes, but it is required
to make things work correctly and to start rolling in support for Oracle.

You will need to run the new phpgroupware/setup/index.php program.  Right now its kind of limited, but 
in the future it might auto update database tables.
