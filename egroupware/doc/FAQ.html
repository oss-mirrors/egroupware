<H2>1.1 Questions and Answers</H2>

<P>Q: When I try to send file attachments, I get errors about safe mode being 
effect.<BR>
A: I ran into this problem after I installed Aeromail for the first time.<BR>
Try chown root.root for all files in your /phpGroupWare directory.  I don't know
why this is needed.  Any ideas ?
<P>Q: Why don't you just use the session class from phplib? Why not use cookies
to hold the sessionid?<BR>
A: I personally don't like using cookies for something like this.<BR>
However, the session management is currently being abstracted for the applications.
This means that switching to cookies will be possible for those that are interested.
<P>Q: When I do a search, it returns the results but they have the wrong date.<BR>
A: Becuase of the way the tables are set up to handle repeating events,
I need to rewrite the query.  I have not had a chance to play around with it
<P>Q: When I view the calendar, I get tons of SQL errors.<BR>
A: Make sure all users on the system belong to a group.  That should clear up
any problems.  This is something that needs to be fixed.
<P>Q: Will phpGroupWare run on PHP4 ?<BR>
A: Yes. It runs on both PHP3 and PHP4.
<P>Q: Will phpGroupWare work with SSL ?<BR>
A: Sure, why not ?  I am running it with mod_ssl and have had no problems.
Since there are no references to http:// or https:// there should not be
any problems with it.
<P>Q: Does phpGroupWare work on any other databases ?<BR>
A: Right now, no.  I have been playing around with support for mSQL, but, that
will take some time.  Other databases are completly unknown at this point,
support for Oracle, MS-SQL, and others are planned for the future.
<P>Q: I am having problems installing on PostgreSQL 6.x.<BR>
A: phpGroupWare is being developed with version 7.x.  I tried installing it on
6.x and ran into a bunch of probelms.  Unless you plan on toying around
with it, your better off with 7.x.
<P>Q: Will phpGroupWare work with Windows?<BR>
A: Yes, there several people who are using it.<BR>
Thanks Vincent Larchet &lt;&lt;vinz@users.sourceforge.net&gt;> for patching anything 
we do that breaks phpGroupWare on NT.
