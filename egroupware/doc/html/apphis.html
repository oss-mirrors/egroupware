>		phpGroupWare started by Jengo (Joseph Engo) as an application to satisfy his girlfriends need for a webbased calendar/todo_list/email. 
		At the time it was called webdistro when Seek3r (Dan Kuykendall) discovered this promising project.
		The two joined up together and between Seek3r's API design and Jengo's programming skills they renamed the project phpGroupWare and started building the application around the phpgwAPI.
	</P
><P
>		During this period Seek3r took over project management to free Jengo up to do more development. 
		This duo worked hard to build a sucessful community around the project. Their efforts paid off, and the project is what it is today due to the efforts of the developers who have joined this community.
