<toc>
<sect>Introduction
<p>
  phpGroupWare is a web based groupware application that includes integrated features such as 
  email, calendar, todo list, address book, file manager, headline news, and a trouble ticket system.
  <p>It should run on all systems where PHP is avalible and currently supports MySQL and PostgreSQL.
</p>
<sect1>What is phpGroupWare and why should I use it?
<p>
  phpGroupWare is:<p>
  phpGroupWare is a web based groupware application that includes integrated features such as 
  email, calendar, todo list, address book, file manager, headline news, and a trouble ticket system.<P>

  You should use it if:<p>
  You would like a powerful groupware system that can be access from anywhere on the Internet. 
  For companies with a distributed user base, it's an ideal solution. Oh, and did I mention that its FREE?
</p>
<sect>Installation
<sect1>Requirements
<p>
  You will need PHP compiled and installed on your system.  You will also need MySQL or PostgreSQL setup. 
  If you are planning on using the email system, you will need to have an IMAP server installed and IMAP support compiled into PHP.
  You can have it installed as an Apache module or command line version, the Apache module is prefered.
  We will assume that you are running on a Linux or other Unix system for these steps. 
  Windows is supported, but there is no documentation for it currently.
</p>
<sect1>Tested Systems
<p>
  On Linux 2.2.x
  <itemize>
    <item>PHP 3.0.15+ / PHP 4.0.x
    <item>Apache 1.3.x
    <item>MySQL 3.22.25 or PostgreSQL 7.0.x
    <item>Courier-IMAP 0.33+
  </itemize>

  We have reports of it working on Windows NT and OS/2.
</p>
<sect1>Tested Systems
<p>
  After you have met the system requirements, unpack the tarball in the html 
  directory of your webserver. (eg, /home/httpd/html)
  <p>
  The first step is to setup the database and create the tables needed.  In the 
  doc directory there is a file called create_tables.(name of your database)
</p>
<sect2>Installation with MySQL
<p>
  We will assume that you are using the database named phpgroupware.<p>
  <tt>$ mysql phpgroupware -u username -p < create_tables.mysql</tt>
</p>
<sect2>Installation with PostgreSQL
<p>
  We will assume that you are using the database named phpgroupware.<p>
  <tt>$ psql -d phpgroupware -U username < create_tables.pgsql</tt>
</p>
<sect1>Configure phpGroupWare
<p>
  Change to the inc directory. <newline>
  Edit globalconfig.inc.php to reflect your system settings.
<p>
  If you are using the email system you will need to create a temporary directory 
  where file uploads will be stored.  For security reasons, you should <tt>chown
  nobody.nobody</tt> and <tt>chmod 700</tt> to that directory.  Depending on your system configuration.  
  Default installs of Apache normally run as the user nobody.  You may need your system 
  administrator to do this for you if you do not have root access.
<p>
  If you do not have access to root, create this file and run it.
<verb>
  <?php 
    if (mkdir("/path/to/temp/directory",0700)) { 
      echo "Directory created successfully"; 
    } else { 
      echo "Error creating directory"; 
    }
</verb>
  If you have access to cron, you may want to setup the files in the cron 
  directory.
<p>
  stalesessions.pl - There are 2 reasons for this file. 
<itemize>
  <item>Users always forget to logout. This way the session doesn't sit around forever, creating a possible security risk. 
  <item>The email system requires plain text passwords which are stored in the sessions table.
</itemize>

  This file is not required, you can simply disable cron_apps in the admin -> applications section
  to clean out the sessions table durring login and logout.
<p>
  stale_uploads.pl - This will delete file attachments for messages that where not 
  completed.  If a users browser crashes, internet connection dies, etc, their
  files will sit there forever unless deleted.  You could add a few lines to 
  logout.php that will look in the temp directory for any stale uploads and delete 
  them.  But, once again, it becomes a performance issue.
<p>
  If your config is setup properly you can now login.  Point your browser to the 
  installed location and login with the username <tt>demo</tt> and the password is <tt>1234</tt><newline>
  At this point it would be a good idea to create a new user and delete the old 
  one.
