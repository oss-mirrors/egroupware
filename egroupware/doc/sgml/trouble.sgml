	<title>I get "Unable to open mailbox" when using the email application</title>
		<para>
			At the time of this writing (2000-09-27) you must use the same
			username and password in phpGroupWare that you use to log into
			your mail server. If you change your password and it still isn't working,
			try logging out of phpGroupWare (the rightmost icon in the navigation bar)
			and then log back in.
		</para>
                <para>
			An preference page to edit the email settings is being developed, and should
			appear shortly after the first beta release.

	<title>It seems to hang when I try to read my mail</title>
		<para>
			This is often a problem if you are using POP3 instead of IMAP, and you have
			more than a few hundred messages in your mailbox.
		</para>
		<para>
			By default, php is set up to time-out a request that takes over 30 seconds
			to complete. phpGroupWare must do a lot of work the first time your POP3 mailbox
			is opened, and every time you get new mail, which may take more than the 30
			second timeout.
		</para>
                <para>
			You can either clean up your mailbox with another mail program, or
			add the line
			<programlisting>
set_time_limit(0);
			</programlisting>
			to the top of the phpgwapi/inc/phpgw_msg_pop3.inc.php file, just before
			the line <classname>class msg extends msg_common</classname>
                </para>
                <para>
			If you choose to edit the file, be patient when loading a large POP3
			mailbox - the author tested against a mailbox with 2500 messages in it,
			but it took 15 minutes to load the page. We highly suggest you use IMAP
			if you expect to have more than a few hundred messages in your mailbox.

	<title>When I log in I see the directory listing instead of a web page</title>
		<para>You are using Apache, this often means you need to add
	              <classname>.php</classname> to the <classname>DirectoryIndex</classname> line in your httpd.conf file.
	              For example:
		      <programlisting>
DirectoryIndex index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm index.cgi
		      </programlisting>
		</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="trob4">
	<title>I get garbage that looks like code when I go to the phpGroupWare URL</title>
		<para>
			This is often because you have php3 installed,
			which does not map <classname>.php</classname> to the PHP engine.
                        For PHP3:
			<programlisting>
AddType             application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 .php
			</programlisting>
For PHP4:
			<programlisting>
AddType             application/x-httpd-php .php3 .php
			</programlisting>
