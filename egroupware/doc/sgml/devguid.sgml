		<title>Writing/porting your application</title>
		<para><emphasis>Include files</emphasis></para>
		<para>
			Each PHP page you write will need to include the header.inc.php along
			with a few variables.This is done by putting this at the top of each PHP page.
		
			<programlisting>
&lt;?php
  $phpgw_info["flags"]["currentapp"] = "appname";
  include("../header.inc.php");
  ?&gt;
			</programlisting>
		Of course change application name to fit.
  		This include will provide the following things:
  		<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
  		<listitem><para>The phpgwAPI - The phpGroupWare API will be loaded.</para></listitem>
  		<listitem><para>The phpGW navbar will be loaded (by default, but can be disabled until a later point.</para></listitem>
  		<listitem><para>appname/inc/functions.inc.php - This file is loaded just after the phpgwAPI
  				and before any HTML code is generated. This file should include all your application
  				specific functions..You are welcome to include any additional files you need from within
  				this file. </para></listitem>
  		<listitem><para>appname/inc/header.inc.php - This file is loaded just after the system header/navbar,
  			        and allows developers to use it for whatever they need to load.</para></listitem>
  		<listitem><para>appname/inc/footer.inc.php - This file is loaded just before the system footer,
  				allowing developers to close connections and whatever else they need.</para></listitem>
