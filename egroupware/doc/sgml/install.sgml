	<title>Installing from TarBall</title>
  		<para>Installing from a TarBall is very easy. The files should be
  	                 installed in the webserver directory. So all you need to
  	                 do is unpack the tar ball and copy the whole directory to
  	                 the webserver directory (eg. /home/httpd/html for default
  	                 apache configuration in many linux distros).You may
  	                 have to get required permissions to do this. Contact
  	                 your system administrator if you dont have the permission
  	                 to write to your webserver directory
  	         </para>

		<para>
	      		Copy the <filename>header.inc.php.sample</filename> file to
	      		<filename>header.inc.php</filename> and edit the file, following the
	      		directions in the comments.
		</para>
		<para>
	      		Then point your browser to phpgroupware/setup/ which will
	      		create (or upgrade) the database tables.
	      		You wil be asked to login, using the password set in
	      		<filename>header.inc.php</filename>. Setup will attempt to determine what version
	      		of the phpGroupWare database you have installed, and upgrade to the most recent
	      		version.
                	</para>

          	<para>
                	The developers are concentrating on getting the beta
	                working, and have not spent a great deal of time building upgrade scripts from the
  		        alpha versions of phpGroupWare. You are advised to backup your existing alpha
  			database before running the setup script to avoid problems!
  		</para>
  			</note>
                <para>
  			If you get no error messages, continue on to phpgroupware/setup/config.php
  			to configure phpGroupWare to your system.
  		</para>
  		<para>
  			If you are using the email system you will need to create a temporary directory
  			where file uploads will be stored.  For security reasons, you should <constant>chown
  			nobody.nobody</constant> and <constant>chmod 700</constant> to that directory.  Depending on your system configuration.
  			Default installs of Apache normally run as the user nobody.  You may need your system
  			administrator to do this for you if you do not have root access.
  		</para>
  		<para>
  		        If you do not have access to root, create this file and run it.

	        	If you have access to cron, you may want to setup the files in the cron
			directory.

			stalesessions.pl - There are 2 reasons for this file.
			<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
			<listitem><para>Users always forget to logout. This way the session doesn't sit around forever, creating a possible security risk.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>The email system requires plain text passwords which are stored in the sessions table.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			 This file is not required, you can simply disable cron_apps in the admin -> applications section
  			 to clean out the sessions table during login and logout
  	        </para>
  	        <para>
  	        	stale_uploads.pl - This will delete file attachments for messages that where not
			completed.  If a users browser crashes, Internet connection dies, etc, their
			files will sit there forever unless deleted.  You could add a few lines to
			logout.php that will look in the temp directory for any stale uploads and delete
			them.  But, once again, it becomes a performance issue.

      	<title>Testing the install</title>
       	<para>
        	If your config is setup properly you can now login.  Point your browser to the
		installed location and login with the username <classname>demo</classname> and the password is <classname>1234</classname>
		At this point it would be a good idea to create a new user with administrative privileges and
		delete the old one.
