   	<title>Setting File Permissions</title>
    <para>
      There are a few directories which will need special fie permissions set for phpGroupWare to work properly. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Temp Directory (Required) - This can be /tmp for simplicity, but it is required for several apps to function properly. 
      Simply make sure that the webserver can add/delete files in it.
    </para>
    <para>
      Files Directory (Required) - This can be should be the files dir under the phpgroupware dir. You will need to give the webserver account owndership of this directory.
		  <programlisting>
chown nobody:nobody
chmod 700 /home/httpd/html/phpgroupware/files
		  </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Root Directory (Not recommended) - If you give the webserver account write access to the phpgroupware directory, then the setup program can create the header.inc.php for you. 
      Otherwise you will need to use the setup program to create it, and then you can manually save it to file.
		  <programlisting>
If you want to do it:
chown :nobody /home/httpd/html/phpgroupware
chmod 770
		  </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
		  You may have to get  required permissions to do this.
