        	<title>Overview of application writing</title>
        	<para>
        		We have attempted to make writing application for phpGroupWare as
        		painless as possible. We hope any pain and suffering is cause by making
        		your application work, but not dealing with phpGroupWare itself.

        	<title>What does the phpGroupWare API provide?</title>
        	<para>
        		The phpGroupWare API handles session management, user/group management,
        		has support for multiple databases, using the PHPLIB database abstraction
        		method, we support templates using the PHPLIB Templates class, a file
        		system interface, and even a network i/o interface. On top of these
        		standard functions, phpGroupWare provides several functions to give
        		you the information you need about the users environment, and to properly
        		plug into phpGroupWare.
