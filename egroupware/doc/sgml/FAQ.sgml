<sect1>Questions and Answers
<p>
Q: When I try to send file attachments, I get errors about safe mode being 
   effect.<newline>
A: I ran into this problem after I installed Aeromail for the first time.<newline>
   Try chown root.root for all files in your /phpGroupWare directory.  I don't know
   why this is needed.  Any ideas ?
<p>
Q: Why don't you just use the session class from phplib? Why not use cookies
   to hold the sessionid?<newline>
A: I personally don't like using cookies for something like this.<newline>
   However, the session management is currently being abstracted for the applications.
   This means that switching to cookies will be possible for those that are interested.
<p>
Q: When I do a search, it returns the results but they have the wrong date.<newline>
A: Becuase of the way the tables are set up to handle repeating events,
   I need to rewrite the query.  I have not had a chance to play around with it
<p>
Q: When I view the calendar, I get tons of SQL errors.<newline>
A: Make sure all users on the system belong to a group.  That should clear up
   any problems.  This is something that needs to be fixed.
<p>
Q: Will phpGroupWare run on PHP4 ?<newline>
A: Yes. It runs on both PHP3 and PHP4.
<p>
Q: Will phpGroupWare work with SSL ?<newline>
A: Sure, why not ?  I am running it with mod_ssl and have had no problems.
   Since there are no references to http:// or https:// there should not be
   any problems with it.
<p>
Q: Does phpGroupWare work on any other databases ?<newline>
A: Right now, no.  I have been playing around with support for mSQL, but, that
   will take some time.  Other databases are completly unknown at this point,
   support for Oracle, MS-SQL, and others are planned for the future.
<p>
Q: I am having problems installing on PostgreSQL 6.x.<newline>
A: phpGroupWare is being developed with version 7.x.  I tried installing it on
   6.x and ran into a bunch of probelms.  Unless you plan on toying around
   with it, your better off with 7.x.
<p>
Q: Will phpGroupWare work with Windows?<newline>
A: Yes, there several people who are using it.<newline>
   Thanks Vincent Larchet <&lt;vinz@users.sourceforge.net&gt;> for patching anything 
   we do that breaks phpGroupWare on NT.
