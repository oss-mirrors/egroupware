  Q: When I try to send file attachments, I get errors about safe mode
  being effect.
  A: I ran into this problem after I installed Aeromail for the first
  time.
  Try chown root.root for all files in your /phpGroupWare directory.  I
  don't know why this is needed.  Any ideas ?

  Q: Why don't you just use the session class from phplib? Why not use
  cookies to hold the sessionid?
  A: I personally don't like using cookies for something like this.
  However, the session management is currently being abstracted for the
  applications.  This means that switching to cookies will be possible
  for those that are interested.

  Q: When I do a search, it returns the results but they have the wrong
  date.
  A: Becuase of the way the tables are set up to handle repeating
  events, I need to rewrite the query.  I have not had a chance to play
  around with it

  Q: When I view the calendar, I get tons of SQL errors.
  A: Make sure all users on the system belong to a group.  That should
  clear up any problems.  This is something that needs to be fixed.

  Q: Will phpGroupWare run on PHP4 ?
  A: Yes. It runs on both PHP3 and PHP4.

  Q: Will phpGroupWare work with SSL ?
  A: Sure, why not ?  I am running it with mod_ssl and have had no
  problems.  Since there are no references to http:// or https:// there
  should not be any problems with it.

  Q: Does phpGroupWare work on any other databases ?
  A: Right now, no.  I have been playing around with support for mSQL,
  but, that will take some time.  Other databases are completly unknown
  at this point, support for Oracle, MS-SQL, and others are planned for
  the future.

  Q: I am having problems installing on PostgreSQL 6.x.
  A: phpGroupWare is being developed with version 7.x.  I tried
  installing it on 6.x and ran into a bunch of probelms.  Unless you
  plan on toying around with it, your better off with 7.x.

  Q: Will phpGroupWare work with Windows?
  A: Yes, there several people who are using it.
  Thanks Vincent Larchet <<vinz@users.sourceforge.net>> for patching
  anything we do that breaks phpGroupWare on NT.
