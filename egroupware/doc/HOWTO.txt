  phpGroupWare is a web based groupware application that includes
  integrated features such as email, calendar, todo list, address book,
  file manager, headline news, and a trouble ticket system.

  It should run on all systems where PHP is available and currently
  supports MySQL and PostgreSQL.

  phpGroupWare is a web based groupware application that includes

  file manager, headline news, and a trouble ticket system.



  You should use it if:

  You would like a powerful groupware system that can be access from
  anywhere on the Internet.  For companies with a distributed user base,
  it's an ideal solution. Oh, and did I mention that its FREE?

  22..  IInnssttaallllaattiioonn

  You will need PHP compiled and installed on your system.  You will
  also need MySQL or PostgreSQL setup.  If you are planning on using the
  email system, you will need to have an IMAP server installed and IMAP
  support compiled into PHP.  You can have it installed as an Apache
  module or command line version, the Apache module is preferred.  We
  will assume that you are running on a Linux or other Unix system for
  these steps.  Windows is supported, but there is no documentation for
  it currently.

  22..22..  TTeesstteedd SSyysstteemmss

  On Linux 2.2.x

  +o  PHP 3.0.15+ / PHP 4.0.x

  +o  Apache 1.3.x

  +o  MySQL 3.22.25 or PostgreSQL 7.0.x

  +o  Courier-IMAP 0.33+

  +o  qmail 1.03 (using the qmail POP3 server)

  We have reports of it working on Windows NT and OS/2, and using Oracle
  as the database.

  22..33..  TTeesstteedd SSyysstteemmss

  After you have met the system requirements, unpack the tarball in the
  html directory of your webserver. (eg, /home/httpd/html)

  The first step is to setup the database and create the tables needed.
  In the doc directory there is a file called create_tables.(name of
  your database)

  22..33..11..  IInnssttaallllaattiioonn wwiitthh MMyySSQQLL

  We will assume that you are using the database named phpgroupware.

  $ mysql phpgroupware -u username -p < create_tables.mysql Then add the
  language entries (used for translation purposes).

  $ mysql phpgroupware -u username -p < lang.sql

  22..33..22..  IInnssttaallllaattiioonn wwiitthh PPoossttggrreeSSQQLL

  We will assume that you are using the database named phpgroupware.

  $ psql -d phpgroupware -U username < create_tables.pgsql Then add the
  language entries (used for translation purposes).

  $ psql -d phpgroupware -U username < lang.sql

  Copy the header.inc.php.sample file to header.inc.php and edit the
  file, following the directions in the comments.

  Change to the inc directory.
  Copy globalconfig.inc.php.sample to globalconfig.inc.php and edit it
  to reflect your system settings, again following the comments in the
  file.

  If you are using the email system you will need to create a temporary
  directory where file uploads will be stored.  For security reasons,
  you should chown nobody.nobody and chmod 700 to that directory.
  Depending on your system configuration.  Default installs of Apache
  normally run as the user nobody.  You may need your system
  administrator to do this for you if you do not have root access.

  If you do not have access to root, create this file and run it.

    <?php
      if (mkdir("/path/to/temp/directory",0700)) {
        echo "Directory created successfully";
      } else {
        echo "Error creating directory";
      }


  If you have access to cron, you may want to setup the files in the
  cron directory.

  stalesessions.pl - There are 2 reasons for this file.

  +o  Users always forget to logout. This way the session doesn't sit
     around forever, creating a possible security risk.

  +o  The email system requires plain text passwords which are stored in
     the sessions table.

  This file is not required, you can simply disable cron_apps in the
  admin -> applications section to clean out the sessions table during
  login and logout.

  stale_uploads.pl - This will delete file attachments for messages that
  where not completed.  If a users browser crashes, Internet connection
  dies, etc, their files will sit there forever unless deleted.  You
  could add a few lines to logout.php that will look in the temp
  directory for any stale uploads and delete them.  But, once again, it
  becomes a performance issue.

  If your config is setup properly you can now login.  Point your
  browser to the installed location and login with the username demo and
  the password is 1234
  At this point it would be a good idea to create a new user with
  administrative privileges and delete the old one.

  Once you have the core phpGroupWare install up and running, you may
  want to download and install additional applications.

  You should consult any README or INSTALL files that come with the new
  application first, as most require you to create additional tables in
  the database, and add additional translation data to the lang table
  (typically a file called lang.sql)
  You install the new application within the phpGroupWare install tree
  by copying the application directory into the phpGroupWare install
  location, and enabling the application through the Administration
  page.

  For example, this is the process to install the Headlines application
  (see  <http://sourceforge.net/phpgwapps/> for more on this and other
  applications).

  +o  Download the .tar.gz file for the application, or check out the
     source with cvs with

     export CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpgroupware.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpgwapps'
     cvs login   (just hit enter if prompted for a password)
     cvs co headlines



  +o  Move the headlines directory into your phpGroupWare install
     directory.

  +o  Log into phpGroupWare as an administrative user, and go to the
     Administration page.

  +o  In the first section, choose the Applications link

  +o  Click on add, and fill in the form.

     AApppplliiccaattiioonn nnaammee
        should be identical to the name of the directory you moved into
        the phpGroupWare install, in this case use headlines

     AApppplliiccaattiioonn TTiittllee
        this is shown in the navigation bar and other places to refer to
        the new application. Enter Headlines for this example.

     EEnnaabblleedd
        This can be used to disable an application for all users
        temporially. You should normal check the box to enable the
        application.

  +o  Back in the Administration page, you need to enable the application
     for specific users or user groups by editing them, and checking the
     new Headlines box that appears in the middle of the account editing
     page.

  +o  Once you have added the Headlines app to your account, you should
     see a Headlines entry in the Administration and Preferences pages,
     and there should be an icon for the Headlines application in the
     navigation bar.

  +o  Once you enable a few of the Headlines sites through the
     Administration page link, you should see headlines grabbed from the
     sites you selected when you click on the Headlines icon in the
     navigation bar.

  WWAARRNNIINNGG!! phpGroupWare is still Beta software, expect some bugs along
  the way. If you run into a problem not discussed here, contact us
  through one of the methods listed on the website.

  The phpGroupWare developers can often be seen hanging out in
  #phpGroupWare on irc.openprojects.net if you require real-time help.


  Also check the FAQ in this directory for additional common questions,
  it is available as FAQ.sgml, FAQ.txt and FAQ.html

  At the time of this writing (2000-09-27) you must use the same
  username and password in phpGroupWare that you use to log into your
  mail server. If you change your password and it still isn't working,
  try logging out of phpGroupWare (the rightmost icon in the navigation
  bar) and then log back in.

  An preference page to edit the email settings is being developed, and
  should appear shortly after the first beta release.

  This is often a problem if you are using POP3 instead of IMAP, and you
  have more than a few hundred messages in your mailbox.

  By default, php is set up to time-out a request that takes over 30
  seconds to complete. phpGroupWare must do a lot of work the first time
  your POP3 mailbox is opened, and every time you get new mail, which
  may take more than the 30 second timeout.

  You can either clean up your mailbox with another mail program, or add
  the line

  ______________________________________________________________________
  set_time_limit(0);
  ______________________________________________________________________


  to the top of the inc/phpgwapi/phpgw_msg_pop3.inc.php file, just
  before the line

  class msg extends msg_common



  If you choose to edit the file, be patient when loading a large POP3
  mailbox - the author tested against a mailbox with 2500 messages in
  it, but it took 15 minutes to load the page. We highly suggest you use
  IMAP if you expect to have more than a few hundred messages in your
  mailbox.

  If you are using Apache, this often means you need to add .php to the
  DirectoryIndex line in your httpd.conf file.

  For example:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  DirectoryIndex index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm index.cgi
  ______________________________________________________________________

  UURRLL

  This is often because you have php3 installed, which does not map .php
  to the PHP engine.


  For PHP3:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  AddType             application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 .php
  ______________________________________________________________________


  For PHP4:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  AddType             application/x-httpd-php .php3 .php
  ______________________________________________________________________
