  phpGroupWare is a web based groupware application that includes
  integrated features such as email, calendar, todo list, address book,
  file manager, headline news, and a trouble ticket system.

  It should run on all systems where PHP is avalible and currently
  supports MySQL and PostgreSQL.

  You should use it if:

  You would like a powerful groupware system that can be access from
  anywhere on the Internet.  For companies with a distributed user base,
  it's an ideal solution. Oh, and did I mention that its FREE?

  You will need PHP compiled and installed on your system.  You will
  also need MySQL or PostgreSQL setup.  If you are planning on using the
  email system, you will need to have an IMAP server installed and IMAP
  support compiled into PHP.  You can have it installed as an Apache
  module or command line version, the Apache module is prefered.  We
  will assume that you are running on a Linux or other Unix system for
  these steps.  Windows is supported, but there is no documentation for
  it currently.

  +o  Apache 1.3.x

  +o  MySQL 3.22.25 or PostgreSQL 7.0.x

  +o  Courier-IMAP 0.33+

  We have reports of it working on Windows NT, but no details at this
  time.

  After you have met the system requirements, unpack the tarball in the
  html directory of your webserver. (eg, /home/httpd/html)

  The first step is to setup the database and create the tables needed.
  In the doc directory there is a file called create_tables.(name of
  your database)

  We will assume that you are using the database named phpgroupware.

  $ mysql phpgroupware -u username -p < create_tables.mysql

  $ psql -d phpgroupware -U username < create_tables.pgsql

  Change to the inc directory.
  Edit the file called config.inc.php to point to the location of your
  include files.

       Some people might prefer to install their include files in a directory
       which is not world viewable.  For this, you will need to move every-
       thing except config.inc.php into another directory and point con-
       fig.inc.php to that directory.  For most installations, the current
       location of these file should be fine.


  Edit globalconfig.inc.php to reflect your system settings.  You can
  choose which programs you would like to have available to your system.
  For example, if you do not have access to a IMAP server, you can
  change $installed["email"] = "Y";  to $installed["email"] = "N";
  This would make this program unavaiable to all users regardless of
  their permissions.

  If you are using the email system you will need to create a temporary
  directory where file uploads will be stored.  For security reasons,
  you should chown nobody.nobody and chmod 700 to that directory.
  Depending on your system configuration.  Default installs of Apache
  normally run as the user nobody.  You may need your system
  administrator to do this for you if you do not have root access.

  If you do not have access to root, create this file and run it.

    <?php
      if (mkdir("/path/to/temp/directory",0700)) {
        echo "Directory created successfully";
      } else {
        echo "Error creating directory";
      }


  If you have access to cron, you may want to setup the files in the
  cron directory.

  stalesessions.pl - There are 2 reasons for this file.

  +o  Users always forget to logout. This way the session doesn't sit
     around forever, creating a possible security risk.

  +o  The email system requires plain text passwords which are stored in
     the sessions table.

  This file is not required, you can simply uncomment the lines
  indicated in session.class in update_dla().  This will require an
  extra query during every transaction which could cause performance
  problems.  Also, if there are no logins in a few days, they will sit
  around and wait for someone to login before they are deleted.  If you
  go this route, you will need to edit the number of seconds until they
  are deleted.  It defaults to 2 hours (7200 secs).  If you choose to
  use the cron program, simply edit the settings for your database and
  uncomment the line for your database type.

  stale_uploads.pl - This will delete file attachments for messages that
  where not completed.  If a users browser crashes, internet connection
  dies, etc, their files will sit there forever unless deleted.  You
  could add a few lines to logout.php that will look in the temp
  directory for any stale uploads and delete them.  But, once again, it
  becomes a performance issue.

  If your config is setup properly you can now login.  Point your
  browser to the installed location and login with the username demo and
  the password is 1234
  At this point it would be a good idea to create a new user and delete
  the old one.

  Thanks to Joesph Engo for starting phpGroupWare (at the time called
  webdistro) and the core of this HOWTO.  Thanks to all the developers
  and users who contribute to making phpGroupWare such a success.
