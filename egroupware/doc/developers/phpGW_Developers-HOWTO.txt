  11..  IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn

  phpGroupWare is a web based groupware application framework (API), for
  writing applications. Integrated applications such as email, calendar,
  todo list, address book, and file manager are included.

  11..11..  OOvveerrvviieeww ooff aapppplliiccaattiioonn wwrriittiinngg

  We have attempted to make writing application for phpGroupWare as
  painless as possible.  We hope any pain and suffering is cause by
  making your application work, but not dealing with phpGroupWare
  itself.

  11..22..  WWhhaatt ddooeess tthhee pphhppGGrroouuppWWaarree AAPPII pprroovviiddee??

  The phpGroupWare API handles session management, user/group
  management, has support for multiple databases, using the PHPLIB
  database abstraction method, we support templates using the PHPLIB
  Templates class, a file system interface, and even a network i/o
  interface.
  On top of these standard functions, phpGroupWare provides several
  functions to give you the information you need about the users
  environment, and to properly plug into phpGroupWare.

  22..11..  RReeqquuiirreemmeennttss

  These guidelines must be followed for any application that wants
  considered for inclusion into phpGroupWare deluxe.

  It must run on PHP3 and PHP4.
  SQL statements must be compatible with both MySQL and PostgreSQL.
  It must use our default header.inc.php include.
  It must use our $phpgw_link($url) for all links (this is for session
  support).
  It must use "post" for forms.
  It must respect phpGW group rights and phpGW user permissions.
  It must use our directory structure, template support and lang (multi-
  language) support.
  Where possible it should run on both Unix and NT platforms.

  For applications that do not meet these requirements, they can be
  available to users via the phpGroupWare Apps project, or whatever
  means the developers decide.
  If you need help converting your application to templates and our lang
  support, we will try to connect you with someone to help.

  22..22..11..  IInncclluuddee ffiilleess

  Each PHP page you write will need to include the header.inc.php along
  with a few variables.
  This is done by putting this at the top of each PHP page.

  ______________________________________________________________________
    <?php
    $phpgw_info["flags"]["currentapp"] = "appname";
    include("../header.inc.php");
    ?>
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Of course change application name to fit.
  This include will provide the following things:

  +o  The phpgwAPI - The phpGroupWare API will be loaded.

  +o  The phpGW navbar will be loaded (by default, but can be disabled
     until a later point.

  +o  appname/inc/functions.inc.php - This file is loaded just after the
     phpgwAPI and before any HTML code is generated. This file should
     include all your application specific functions.. You are welcome
     to include any additional files you need from within this file.

  +o  appname/inc/header.inc.php - This file is loaded just after the
     system header/navbar, and allows developers to use it for whatever
     they need to load.

  +o  appname/inc/footer.inc.php - This file is loaded just before the
     system footer, allowing developers to close connections and
     whatever else they need.

  +o  The phpGW footer will be loaded, which closes several connections.

  33..11..  OOvveerrvviieeww

  It is fairly simple to add and delete applications to/from
  phpGroupWare.

  33..22..  AAuuttoommaattiicc ffeeaattuurreess

  To make things easy for developers we go ahead and load the following
  files.

  +o  appname/inc/functions.inc.php - This file should include all your
     application specific functions.

  +o  appname/inc/header.inc.php - This file is loaded just after the
     system header/navbar, and allows developers to use it for whatever
     they need to load.

  +o  appname/inc/footer.inc.php - This file is loaded just before the
     system footer, allowing developers to close connections and
     whatever else they need.

  You will need to create the following directories for your code
  (replace 'appname' with your application name)

    `-- appname
        `-- images
        |   `-- navbar.gif
        `-- inc
        |   |-- functions.inc.php
        |   |-- header.inc.php
        |   |-- footer.inc.php
        |   |-- preferences.inc.php
        |   `-- admin.inc.php
        `-- templates
            `-- default




  33..44..  MMaakkiinngg pphhppGGrroouuppWWaarree aawwaarree ooff yyoouurr aapppplliiccaattiioonn

  To make the application aware of your application, add your
  application details to the applications table. This can be done via
  the GUI administration screen, or via a SQL script.

    insert into applications (app_name, app_title, app_enabled) values ('appname', 'The App name', 1);



  33..55..  HHooookkiinngg iinnttoo AAddmmiinniissttrraattiioonn ppaaggee

  When a user goes to the Administration page, it stats
  appname/inc/admin.inc.php for each application that is enabled, in
  alphabetical order of application title.  If the file exists, it is
  include()d in the hopes it will display a selection of links to
  configure that application.

  Simple Example:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  <?php
    $img = "/" . $appname . "/images/navbar.gif";
    section_start("My Application",$img);
    echo "<a HREF=\"" . $phpgw->link("myAdminPage.php") . "\">";
    echo lang("Change myApp settings") . "</a>";
    section_end();
  ?>
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Look at headlines/inc/admin.inc.php and admin/inc/admin.inc.php for
  more examples.

  Things to note:

  +o  Links are relative to the admin/index.php file, not your
     application's base directory. (so use $appname in your link()
     calls)

  +o  The file is brought in with include() so be careful to not pollute
     the name-space too much

     The standard $phpgw and $phpgw_info variables are in-scope, as is
     $appname which corresponds to the application name in the path.

  There are 2 functions to coordinate the display of each application's
  links, section_start() and section_end()



  33..55..11..  sseeccttiioonn__ssttaarrtt

  section_start($title,$icon_url) starts the section for your
  application. $title is passed through lang() for you. $icon_url should
  be page-relative to admin/index.php or an absolute URL.


  33..55..22..  sseeccttiioonn__eenndd

  section_end() closes the section that was started with
  section_start().


  33..66..  HHooookkiinngg iinnttoo PPrreeffeerreenncceess ppaaggee

  The mechanism to hook into the preferences page is identical to the
  one used to hook into the administration page, however it looks for
  appname/inc/preferences.inc.php instead of appname/inc/admin.inc.php.
  The same functions and variables are defined.

  44..11..  OOvveerrvviieeww

  phpGroupWare attempts to provide developers with a sound directory
  structure to work from.
  The directory layout may seem complex at first, but after some use,
  you will see that it is designed to accommodate a large number of
  applications and functions.

  The translations are now being done thru the database, and will be
  configurable to use other mechanisms.
  We are completing a program called Transy, which will provide
  developers/translators a nice GUI for building and updating
  translations.
  In the mean time you will need to create a SQL script yourself and
  name it lang.sql. You can copy the one in doc/lang.sql and use it as a
  template.

  phpGroupWare attempts to provide developers with a useful API to
  handle common tasks.
  To do this we have created a multi-dimensional class $phpgw->.
  This allows for terrific code organization, and help developers easily
  identify the file that the function is in.  All the files that are
  part of this class are in the inc/core directory and are named to
  match the sub-class.
  Example: $phpgw->send->msg() is in the inc/phpgwapi/phpgw_send.inc.php
  file.

  55..22..11..  $$pphhppggww-->>lliinnkk

  $phpgw->link($url)
  Add support for session management. ALL links must use this, that
  includes href's form actions and header location's.
  If you are just doing a form action back to the same page, you can use
  it without any parameters.
  This function is right at the core of the class because it is used so
  often, we wanted to save developers a few keystrokes.  Example:





  ______________________________________________________________________
  <form name=copy method=post action="<?php echo $phpgw->link();?>">
  /* If session management is done via passing url parameters */
  /* The the result would be */
  /* <form name=copy method=post action="somepage.php?sessionid=87687693276?kp3=kjh98u80"> */

  $phpgw->common->appsession($data)
  Store important information session information that your application
  needs.
  $phpgw->appsession will return the value of your session data is you
  leave the parameter empty [i.e. $phpgw->appsession("")], otherwise it
  will store whatever data you send to it.
  You can also store a comma delimited string and use explode() to turn
  it back into an array when you receive the value back.
  Example:

  ______________________________________________________________________
    $phpgw->common->appsession("/path/to/something");
    echo "Dir: " . $phpgw->common->appsession();

  phpGroupWare attempt to provide developers with as much information
  about the user, group, server, and application configuration as
  possible.
  To do this we provide a multi-dimensional array called
  '$phpgw_info[]', which includes all the information about your
  environment.
  Due to the multi-dimensional array approach. getting these values is
  easy.
  Here are some examples:

  ______________________________________________________________________
    <?php
    // To do a hello username
    echo "Hello " . $phpgw_info["user"]["fullname"];
    //If username first name is John and last name is Doe, prints: 'Hello John Doe'
    ?>
    <?php
    // To find out the location of the imap server
    echo "IMAP Server is named: " . $phpgw_info["server"]["imap_server"];
    //If imap is running on localhost, prints: 'IMAP Server is named: localhost'

  phpGroupWare is built using a multi-language support scheme. This
  means the pages can be translated to other languages very easily.
  Translations of text strings are stored in the phpGroupWare database,
  and can be modified by the phpGroupWare administrator.

  77..22..  HHooww ttoo uussee llaanngg ssuuppppoorrtt

  The lang() function is your application's interface to phpGroupWare's
  internationalization support.

  While developing your application, just wrap all your text output with
  calls to lang(), as in the following code:

  ______________________________________________________________________
    $x = 42;
    echo lang("The counter is %1",$x)."<br>";
  ______________________________________________________________________


  This will attempt to translate "The counter is %1", and return a
  translated version based on the current application and language in
  use. Note how the position that $x will end up is controlled by the
  format string, nnoott by building up the string in your code. This allows
  your application to be translated to languages where the actual number
  is not placed at the end of the string.

  When a translation is not found, the original text will be returned
  with a * after the string.  This makes it easy to develop your
  application, then go back and add missing translations (identified by
  the *) later.

  Without a specific translation in the lang table, the above code will
  print:

  The counter is 42*<br>


  If the current user speaks Italian, they string returned may instead
  be:

  il contatore  42<br>

  lang($key, $m1="", $m2="", $m3="", $m4="", $m5="",
               $m6="", $m7="", $m8="", $m9="", $m10="")



     $$kkeeyy
        is the string to translate and may contain replacement
        directives of the form %n.

     $$mm11
        is the first replacement value or may be an array of replacement
        values (in which case $m2 and above are ignored).

     $$mm22 -- $$mm1100
        the 2nd through 10th replacement values if $m1 is not an array.

  The database is searched for rows with a lang.message_id that matches
  $key.  If a translation is not found, the original $key is used. The
  translation engine then replaces all tokens of the form %N with the
  Nth parameter (either $m1[N] or $mN).

  An application called TTrraannssyy is being developed to make this easier,
  until then you can create the translation data manually.


  77..22..22..11..  TThhee llaanngg ttaabbllee

  The translation class uses the lang table for all translations.  We
  are concerned with 4 of the columns to create a translation:

     mmeessssaaggee__iidd
        The key to identify the message (the $key passed to the lang()
        function). This is written in English.

     aapppp__nnaammee
        The application the translation applies to, or common if it is
        common across multiple applications.

     llaanngg
        The code for the language the translation is in.

     ccoonntteenntt
        The translated string.

  77..22..22..22..  llaanngg..ssqqll

  Currently all applications, and the core phpGroupWare source tree have
  a lang.sql file. This is the place to add translation data. Just add
  lines of the form:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  REPLACE INTO lang (message_id, app_name, lang, content)
  VALUES( 'account has been deleted','common','en','Account has been deleted');
  ______________________________________________________________________


  translating the content to reflect the message_id string in the lang
  language.  If the string is specific to your application, put your
  application name in for app_name otherwise use the name common. The
  message_id should be in lower case for a small increase in speed.

  If you browse through the phpGroupWare sources, you may notice a
  pattern to the return codes used in the higher-level functions.  The
  codes used are partially documented in the doc/developers/CODES file.

  Codes are used as a simple way to communicate common error and
  progress conditions back to the user. They are mapped to a text string
  through the check_code() function, which passes the strings through
  lang() before returning.

  For example, calling

  ______________________________________________________________________
  echo check_code(13);
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Would print

  Your message has been sent



  translated into the current language.
