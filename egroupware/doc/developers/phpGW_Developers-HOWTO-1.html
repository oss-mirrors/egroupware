<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>phpGroupWare is a web based groupware application framework (API), for writing applications. Integrated applications such as 
email, calendar, todo list, address book, and file manager are included.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Overview of application writing</A>
</H2>

<P>We have attempted to make writing application for phpGroupWare as painless as possible. 
We hope any pain and suffering is cause by making your application work, but not dealing with phpGroupWare itself.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What does the phpGroupWare API provide?</A>
</H2>

<P>The phpGroupWare API handles session management, user/group management, has support for multiple databases, using the PHPLIB database abstraction method, we support templates using the PHPLIB Templates class, a file system interface, and even a network i/o interface.<BR>
On top of these standard functions, phpGroupWare provides several functions to give you the information you need about the users environment, and to properly plug into phpGroupWare.
