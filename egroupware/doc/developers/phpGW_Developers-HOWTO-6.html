<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>phpGroupWare attempt to provide developers with as much information about the user, group, server, and application configuration as possible.<BR>
To do this we provide a multi-dimensional array called '$phpgw_info[]', which includes all the information about your environment.<BR>
Due to the multi-dimensional array approach. getting these values is easy. <BR>
Here are some examples:
<HR>
<PRE>
  &lt;?php
  // To do a hello username
  echo "Hello " . $phpgw_info["user"]["fullname"];
  //If username first name is John and last name is Doe, prints: 'Hello John Doe'
  ?>
  &lt;?php
  // To find out the location of the imap server
  echo "IMAP Server is named: " . $phpgw_info["server"]["imap_server"]; 
  //If imap is running on localhost, prints: 'IMAP Server is named: localhost'
  ?>
