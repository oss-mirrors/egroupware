<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Guidelines</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>These guidelines must be followed for any application that wants considered for inclusion into phpGroupWare proper.
<P>It must run on PHP3 and PHP4. <BR>
SQL statements must be compatible with both MySQL and PostgreSQL.<BR>
It must use our default header.inc.php include.<BR>
It must use our <CODE>$phpgw_link($url)</CODE> for all links (this is for session support).<BR>
It must respect phpGW group rights and phpGW user permissions.<BR>
It must use our directory structure, template support and lang (multi-language) support.<BR>
Where possible it should run on both Unix and NT platforms.
<P>For applications that do not meet these requirements, we will store them in a seperate location, indicating their status.<BR>
If you need help converting your application to templates and our lang support, we will try to connect you with someone to help.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Writing/porting your application</A>
</H2>

<H3>Include files</H3>

<P>Each PHP page you write will need to include the header.inc.php along with a few variables.<BR>
This is done by putting this at the top of each PHP page.
<HR>
<PRE>
  &lt;?php
  $phpgw_flags["currentapp"] = "newapp";
  include("../header.inc.php");
  ?>
</PRE>
<HR>

Of course change application name to fit.<BR>
This will include the standard functions, verify the sessionid,  rights to the application, and will toss in the navbar.
<P>If you have other includes, or functions that need to be inserted/run before the navbar replace
<HR>
<PRE>
  $phpgw_flags["currentapp"] = "newapp";
</PRE>
<HR>

with
<HR>
<PRE>
  $phpgw_flags["currentapp"] = "newapp";
  $phpgw_flags["nonavbar"] = True;
</PRE>
<HR>

Then when you are done you need to display the navbar by adding this line:
<HR>
<PRE>
     $phpgw->common->navbar();
</PRE>
<HR>
