<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Using Language Support</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>phpGroupWare is built using a multi-language support scheme. This means the pages can be translated to other languages
very easily. It is done thru a series of lang files, which can be translated and selected by the user.
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 How to use lang support</A>
</H2>

<P>Some instructions on using the lang files.<BR>
Under inc/lang there needs to be a sub-directory for each langague.  Inside the
directory there are a number of files for each application.  There is one common file
which contains a list of words that all applications use.  ie, add, delete, edit, etc...<BR>
Words that are specific to a application should be stored with that applications include file.
<HR>
<PRE>
  function lang_todo($message, $m1 = "", $m2 = "", $m3 = "", $m4 = "")
  {
    $message = strtolower($message);
    switch($message)
    {
       case "urgency": $s = "Urgency"; break;
       case "completed": $s = "completed"; break;
       [ snip ]
       default: $s = "&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt; " . $message;
    }
    return $s;
  }
  
</PRE>
<HR>

The list of words in the left column should always be written in english.  The
second column is used to return those words in that includes language.  <CODE>$m1, $m2,
$m3, and $m4</CODE> are used to pass extra data to be place in the middle of a sentence.<BR>
For example:
<PRE>
You have 29 new messages!
</PRE>

The default should return a bold faced * and the word that wasn't found. This allows users to notice that something is missing in the files and make changes if
necessary.
