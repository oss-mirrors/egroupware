Let me take a few minutes to explain codes.  This is a system that I have been
using for years now to forward generic information to another program.  
Recently I have noticed that all of my programs are differant.  So, I am 
creating a sort of standard for my self.  It you need to tell the user that
they have been logged off successfully.  Would you send the whole string to
login.php or just send a number ?  Even though I call them codes, I use the 
variable cd in the program.  They are checked through check_code(int code).

BTW: Some of these do not apply to this program, the are for completly seperate
programs.  But, might apply to any developing anyone else does.  Feel free to
come up with some of your own.
