** IMPORTANT **

I finally found an old copy of the bookmarks program that I started working on
back in the webdistro days.  The program in its current form will *NOT* work
with phpGroupWare.  The permissions, includes, preferences, etc have changed
greatly since then.  I am not sure if this version even works.

I have released this because there where a few people intersted in working on
it.  Its only the basic frame work.  There is tons of work that is needed with
it.
