Minor TODOs:

- Remove the Email/Telephone Card Fields selection from Preferences and put it
  on Admin Config Page

- populateFullAddConst is in JS but I think it is unnecessary, as changes to this
  fields should be rare. Replace it with a pre-load from PHP

- Insert a Full Add Constant Fields Configuration/Insertion/Removal Interface
  for Admin

- Interface to manage Quick Add fields, as the back-end and plugin already 
  accepts dynamic selected fields
