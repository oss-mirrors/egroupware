    <h2>3.0-rc1</h2>

    <p>Changes since 3.0-Beta:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        ContextMenu plugin (provides a nice context menu with common
        operations, including table ops, link ops, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        CSS plugin (provides an easy way to insert/change CSS classes)
      </li>
      <li>
        FullPage plugin (allows HTMLArea to edit a whole HTML file,
        not only the content within &lt;body&gt;.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Better plugin support (they register information about
        themselves with the editor; can register event handlers for
        the editor, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        New about box ;-)
      </li>
      <li>
        Word cleaner (can be enabled to automatically kill Word crap
        on paste (see Config.killWordOnPaste); otherwise accessible by
        pressing CTRL-0 in the editor; a toolbar button will come up
        soon)
      </li>
      <li>
        Image preview in "insert image" dialog.  Also allows
        modification of current image, if selected.
      </li>
      <li>
        New "insert link" dialog, allows target and title
        specification, allows editing links.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implemented support for text direction (left-to-right or
        right-to-left).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="ChangeLog">Full CVS ChangeLog</a> is now
        automatically generated from the CVS logs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lots of bug fixes!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I don't have the power to go through the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=525656&group_id=69750&func=browse">bug
system</a> at SourceForge
    now.  Some of the bugs reported there may be fixed; I'll update
    their status, some other time.  If you reported bugs there and now
    find them to be fixed, please let me know.</p>

    <h2>Rationale for Beta</h2>

    <p>Why was this released as "Beta"?  The code is quite stable and it
    didn't deserve a "Beta" qualification.  However, there are some things
    left to do for the real 3.0 version.  These things will not affect the
    API to work with HTMLArea, in other words, you can install the Beta
    right now and then install the final release without modifying your
    code.  That's if you don't modify HTMLArea itself.  ;-)</p>

    <h2>To-Do before 3.0 final</h2>

    <ol>

      <li>We should use a single popup interface.  Currently there are two:
      dialog.js and popupwin.js; dialog.js emulates modal dialogs, which
      sucks when you want to open "select-color" from another popup and not
      from the editor itself.  Very buggy in IE.  We should probably use only
      modeless dialogs (that is, popupwin.js).</li>

      <li>Internationalization for the SpellChecker plugin.</li>

      <li>Internationalization for the TableOperations plugin.</li>

      <li>People who sent translations are invited to re-iterate through
        their work and make it up-to-date with lang/en.js which is the main
        lang file for HTMLArea-3.0.  Some things have changed but not all
        translations are updated.</li>

      <li><strong>Documentation</strong>.</li>
