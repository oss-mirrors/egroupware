<div class="content">
	<p>Here are some common answers to common questions. If you need more help you can always visit the <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">TinyMCE Forum</a> on the TinyMCE website.</p>

	<div class="separator"></div>

	<h2>Why does TinyMCE strip aways attributes or tags from my source?</h2>
	<div class="section">
		<p>You need to check out the "<a href="option_valid_elements.html">valid_elements</a>" and "<a href="option_extended_valid_elements.html">extended_valid_elements</a>" option in the configuration. By default, TinyMCE only allows certain tags and attributes. TinyMCE also tries to follow the XHTML specification as much as possible (and so should you), this can cause some unexpected source changes, there are however configururation options to battle this issue, study the configuration options in details.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>TinyMCE changes the path of my images, why?</h2>
	<div class="section">
		<p>
			Different browsers handles images differently, TinyMCE tries to compensate for this and has its own convert URL functions. You can control the behaviour through the configuration, check out the URL section in the <a href="reference_configuration.html">configuration</a> options.
