   VII. About this document
          
I. Introduction

   Do yo have questions on using phpGroupWare , like What? Why? What for?
   What's in for me?
   
   Then you should seriously read this doc :-).

Chapter 1. What is phpGroupWare

   phpGroupWare is a web based groupware application that includes
   integrated features such as email, calendar, todo list, address book,
   file manager, headline news, and a trouble ticket system. It should
   run on all systems where PHP is installed and has access to a SQL
   server (MySQL ,PostgreSQL or Oracle).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Chapter 2. Why should you use it

   You should use it if you would like a powerful groupware system that
   can be access from anywhere on the Internet.
   
   For companies with a distributed user base, it's an ideal solution.
   Oh, and did I mention that its FREE?
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Chapter 3. A short History

   phpGroupWare started by Jengo (Joseph Engo) as an application to
   satisfy his girlfriends need for a webbased calendar/todo_list/email.
   At the time it was called webdistro when Seek3r (Dan Kuykendall)
   discovered this promising project. The two joined up together and
   between Seek3r's API design and Jengo's programming skills they
   renamed the project phpGroupWare and started building the application
   around the phpgwAPI.
   
   During this period Seek3r took over project management to free Jengo
   up to do more development. This duo worked hard to build a sucessful
   community around the project. Their efforts paid off, and the project
   is what it is today due to the efforts of the developers who have
   joined this community.

Chapter 5. Requirements

   You will need PHP compiled and installed on your system. You will also
   need MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle setup.
   
   If you are planning on using the email system, you will need to have
   an IMAP server installed and IMAP support compiled into PHP, or a POP3
   server installed. You can have it installed as an Apache module or CGI
   mode for other web servers, the Apache module is preferred. We will
   assume that you are running on a Linux or other Unix system for these
   steps. Windows is supported, but there is no documentation for it
   currently.
     _________________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________________
   
Chapter 6. Obtaining phpGroupWare

   While we are still in the Beta phase of phpGroupWare, you may want to
   track the CVS copy as closely as possible. The released versions are
   more stable, but often contain bugs that have been fixed in the CVS
   version.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Released Versions

   The downloads section on the site contains links to the most recent
   releases, and several mirror sites for the releases.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Developer's version from CVS

   If you have never used CVS, you may want to read through the
   doucmentation found at www.cvshome.org . The CVS pages for the core
   and apps projects can be found at phpGroupWare Core CVS , and
   phpGroupWare Apps CVS. Follow the directions for Anonymous CVS access
   and you should have the most recent development copy of phpGroupWare
   in no time.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Chapter 7. Installation Steps

   After you have met the system requirements, You can install it from
   the TarBall or you can get it directly from CVS.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Installing from TarBall

   The files should be installed in the webserver directory. So all you
   need to do is unpack the tar ball and copy the whole directory to the
   webserver directory
   
   (eg. /home/httpd/html for default apache configuration in many linux
   distros).
   
   You may have to get required permissions to do this. Contact your
   system administrator if you dont have the permission to write to your
   webserver directory.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Installing from CVS

   Grabbing a copy from CVS is not as hard as it may seem. You will need
   to have a cvs client installed. Then try the following commands:
   
   export
   CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpgroupware.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/
   phpgroupware'
   cvs login (just hit enter when prompted for a password)
   cvs checkout phpgroupware
   If you need to install into a different dirname, you can add ' -d
   dirname' after 'checkout' and before 'phpgroupware'. The commands
   would look like this:
   
   export
   CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpgroupware.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/
   phpgroupware'
   cvs login (just hit enter when prompted for a password)
   cvs checkout -d dirname phpgroupware
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Setup / Configure phpGroupWare

The config file

   Copy the header.inc.php.sample file to header.inc.php and edit the
   file, following the directions in the comments.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Create database in MySQL

   An empty database will be needed for phpGroupWare. Here are the
   instructions for doing so with MySQL. First create the database:
   
   mysqladmin create phpgroupware -p
   Then login to the mysql:
   
   mysql -p
   Finally grant the needed security rights:
   
   grant all on phpgroupware.* to phpgroupware@localhost identified by
   "some_password";
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Create database in PostreSQL

   An empty database will be needed for phpGroupWare. Here are the
   instructions for doing so with PostgreSQL. Create the database:
   
   postmaster -i -D /home/[username]/[dataDir]
   You will probably need to review PostgreSQL documentation for futher
   details.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
The Setup Program

   Then point your browser to phpgroupware/setup/ which will create (or
   upgrade) the database tables. You wil be asked to login, using the
   password set in header.inc.php. Setup will attempt to determine what
   version of the phpGroupWare database you have installed, and upgrade
   to the most recent version.
   
     Note: The developers are concentrating on getting the beta working,
     and have not spent a great deal of time building upgrade scripts
     from the alpha versions of phpGroupWare. You are advised to backup
     your existing alpha database before running the setup script to
     avoid problems!
     
   If you get no error messages, continue on to
   phpgroupware/setup/config.php to configure phpGroupWare to your
   system.
   
   If you are using the email system you will need to create a temporary
   directory where file uploads will be stored. For security reasons, you
   should chown nobody.nobody and chmod 700 to that directory. Depending
   on your system configuration. Default installs of Apache normally run
   as the user nobody. You may need your system administrator to do this
   for you if you do not have root access.
   
   If you do not have access to root, create this file and run it.
?php
if (mkdir("/path/to/temp/directory",0700)) {
echo "Directory created successfully";
} else {
echo "Error creating directory";
}
?

     _________________________________________________________________
   
The phpGroupWare Daemon

   If you have access to cron, you may want to setup the files in the
   cron directory.
   
   stalesessions.pl - There are 2 reasons for this file.
   
     * Users always forget to logout. This way the session doesn't sit
       around forever, creating a possible security risk.
     * The email system requires plain text passwords which are stored in
       the sessions table.
       
   This file is not required, you can simply disable cron_apps in the
   admin -> applications section to clean out the sessions table during
   login and logout
   
   stale_uploads.pl - This will delete file attachments for messages that
   where not completed. If a users browser crashes, Internet connection
   dies, etc, their files will sit there forever unless deleted. You
   could add a few lines to logout.php that will look in the temp
   directory for any stale uploads and delete them. But, once again, it
   becomes a performance issue.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Testing the install

   If your config is setup properly you can now login. Point your browser
   to the installed location and login with the username demo and the
   password is 1234 At this point it would be a good idea to create a new
   user with administrative privileges and delete the old one.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Installing additional applications

   Once you have the core phpGroupWare install up and running, you may
   want to download and install additional applications.
   
   You should consult any README or INSTALL files that come with the new
   application first, as most require you to create additional tables in
   the database, and add additional translation data to the lang table
   (typically a file called lang.sql)
   
   You install the new application within the phpGroupWare install tree
   by copying the application directory into the phpGroupWare install
   location, and enabling the application through the Administration
   page.
   
   For example, this is the process to install the Headlines application
   (see http://sourceforge.net/phpgwapps/ for more on this and other
   applications).
   
     * Download the .tar.gz file for the application, or check out the
       source with cvs with
       export
       CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpgroupware.sourceforge.net:/cvsr
       oot/phpgwapps'
       cvs login (just hit enter if prompted for a password)
       cvs co headlines
     * Move the headlines directory into your phpGroupWare install
       directory.
     * Log into phpGroupWare as an administrative user, and go to the
       Administration page.
     * In the first section, choose the Applications link.
     * Click on add, and fill in the form.
       Application name should be identical to the name of the directory
       you moved into the phpGroupWare install, in this case use
       headlines
       Application Title is shown in the navigation bar and other places
       to refer to the new application. Enter Headlines for this example.
       Enabled can be used to disable an application for all users
       temporially. You should normal check the box to enable the
       application.
     * Back in the Administration page, you need to enable the
       application for specific users or user groups by editing them, and
       checking the new Headlines box that appears in the middle of the
       account editing page.
     * Once you have added the Headlines app to your account, you should
       see a Headlines entry in the Administration and Preferences pages,
       and there should be an icon for the Headlines application in the
       navigation bar.
     * Once you enable a few of the Headlines sites through the
       Administration page link, you should see headlines grabbed from
       the sites you selected when you click on the Headlines icon in the
       navigation bar.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Chapter 8. Trouble Shooting

   Warning
   
   phpGroupWare is still Beta software, expect some bugs along the way.
   If you run into a problem not discussed here, contact us through one
   of the methods listed on the website.
   
   The phpGroupWare developers can most often be seen hanging out in
   #phpGroupWare on irc.openprojects.net if you require real-time help.
   
   Also check the FAQ in this directory for additional common questions,
   it is available as FAQ.sgml, FAQ.txt and FAQ.html
     _________________________________________________________________
   
I get "Unable to open mailbox" when using the email application

   At the time of this writing (2000-09-27) you must use the same
   username and password in phpGroupWare that you use to log into your
   mail server. If you change your password and it still isn't working,
   try logging out of phpGroupWare (the rightmost icon in the navigation
   bar) and then log back in.
   
   An preference page to edit the email settings is being developed, and
   should appear shortly after the first beta release.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
It seems to hang when I try to read my mail

   This is often a problem if you are using POP3 instead of IMAP, and you
   have more than a few hundred messages in your mailbox.
   
   By default, php is set up to time-out a request that takes over 30
   seconds to complete. phpGroupWare must do a lot of work the first time
   your POP3 mailbox is opened, and every time you get new mail, which
   may take more than the 30 second timeout.
   
   You can either clean up your mailbox with another mail program, or add
   the line
set_time_limit(0);
                        
   to the top of the inc/phpgwapi/phpgw_msg_pop3.inc.php file, just
   before the line class msg extends msg_common
   
   If you choose to edit the file, be patient when loading a large POP3
   mailbox - the author tested against a mailbox with 2500 messages in
   it, but it took 15 minutes to load the page. We highly suggest you use
   IMAP if you expect to have more than a few hundred messages in your
   mailbox.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
When I log in I see the directory listing instead of a web page

   You are using Apache, this often means you need to add .php to the
   DirectoryIndex line in your httpd.conf file. For example:
DirectoryIndex index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm index.cgi
                
     _________________________________________________________________
   
I get garbage that looks like code when I go to the phpGroupWare URL

   This is often because you have php3 installed, which does not map .php
   to the PHP engine. For PHP3:
AddType             application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 .php
                        
   For PHP4:
AddType             application/x-httpd-php .php3 .php
