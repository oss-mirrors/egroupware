1 Introduction

eGroupWare is a web based groupware application framework
(API), for writing applications. Integrated applications
such as email, calendar, todo list, address book, and file
manager are included. eGroupWare is a fork of phpGroupWare,
for which the original version of this document was written.

1.1 Overview of application writing

We have attempted to make writing applications for eGroupWare
as painless as possible. We hope any pain and suffering
is caused by making your application work, but not dealing
with eGroupWare itself. 

1.2 What does the eGroupWare API provide?

The eGroupWare API handles session management, user/group
management, has support for multiple databases, using either
PHPLIB or ADODB database abstraction methods, we support
templates using the PHPLIB Templates class, a file system
interface, and even a network i/o interface. 

On top of these standard functions, eGroupWare provides several
functions to give you the information you need about the
users environment, and to properly plug into eGroupWare. 

2 Guidelines

2.1 Requirements

These guidelines must be followed for any application that
wants considered for inclusion into eGroupWare:

* It must run on PHP4 and PHP5. 

* SQL statements must be compatible with both MySQL and PostgreSQL.
  When in doubt it is best to stick with SQL92.

* It must use our default header.inc.php include. 

* It must use our $GLOBALS['phpgw']->link($url) for all links
  (this is for session support). 

* It must use "post" for
  forms. 

* It must respect phpGW group rights and phpGW user permissions. 

* It must use our directory structure, template support and
  lang (multi-language) support. 

* Where possible it should run on both Unix and NT platforms.

* For applications that do not meet these requirements, they
  can be made available to users however you decide. If
  you need help converting your application to templates
  and our lang support, we will try to connect you with
  someone to help. 

2.2 Writing/porting your application

 Include files

Each PHP page you write will need to include the header.inc.php
along with a few variables.
 This is done by putting this at the top of each PHP page.




Of course change application name to fit.
 This include will provide the following things: 

* The phpgwAPI - The eGroupWare API will be loaded. 

* The phpGW navbar will be loaded (by default, but can be
  disabled until a later point. 

* appname/inc/functions.inc.php - This file is loaded just
  after the phpgwAPI and before any HTML code is generated.
  This file should include all your application specific
  functions.. You are welcome to include any additional
  files you need from within this file. 

* appname/inc/header.inc.php - This file is loaded just after
  the system header/navbar, and allows developers to use
  it for whatever they need to load. 

* appname/inc/footer.inc.php - This file is loaded just before
  the system footer, allowing developers to close connections
  and whatever else they need. 

* The phpGW footer will be loaded, which closes several connections.

3 Installing your application

3.1 Overview

It is fairly simple to add and delete applications to/from
eGroupWare. 

3.2 Automatic features

To make things easy for developers we go ahead and load the
following files. 

* appname/inc/functions.inc.php - This file should include
  all your application specific functions. 

* appname/inc/header.inc.php - This file is loaded by $GLOBALS['phpgw']->common->header
  just after the system header/navbar, and allows developers
  to use it for whatever they need to load. 

* appname/inc/footer.inc.php - This file is loaded by $GLOBALS['phpgw']->common->footer
  just before the system footer, allowing developers to
  close connections and whatever else they need.

3.3 Adding files, directories and icons.

You will need to create the following directories for your
code 
 (replace 'appname' with your application name)


`--appname

  |--inc

  |   |--functions.inc.php

  |   |--header.inc.php

  |   |--hook_preferences.inc.php

  |   |--hook_admin.inc.php

  |   `--footer.inc.php

  `--templates

  |   `--default

3.4 Making eGroupWare aware of your application

Please see the documentation in the setup/doc directory for
information on integrating into eGroupWare. This is very
important since the steps for database table setup and modification
discussed there must be followed.

3.5 Hooking into Administration page

When a user goes to the Administration page, it starts appname/inc/hook_admin.inc.php
for each application that is enabled, in alphabetical order
of application title. If the file exists, it is include()d
in the hopes it will display a selection of links to configure
that application.

Simple Example: 

Look at headlines/inc/hook_admin.inc.php and admin/inc/hook_admin.inc.php
for more examples.

Things to note: 

* Links are relative to the admin/index.php file, not your
  application's base directory. (so use $appname in your
  link() calls) 

* The file is brought in with include() so be careful to
  not pollute the name-space too much

The standard $GLOBALS['phpgw'] and $GLOBALS['phpgw_info']
variables are in-scope, as is $appname which corresponds
to the application name in the path.

There are 2 functions to coordinate the display of each application's
links, section_start() and section_end() 

 section_start

section_start($title,$icon_url) starts the section for your
application. $title is passed through lang() for you. $icon_url
should be page-relative to admin/index.php or an absolute
URL. 

 section_end

section_end() closes the section that was started with section_start(). 

3.6 Hooking into Preferences page

The mechanism to hook into the preferences page is identical
to the one used to hook into the administration page, however
it looks for appname/inc/hook_preferences.inc.php instead
of appname/inc/hook_admin.inc.php. The same functions and
variables are defined. 

4 Infrastructure

4.1 Overview

eGroupWare attempts to provide developers with a sound directory
structure to work from.
 The directory layout may seem complex at first, but after
some use, you will see that it is designed to accommodate
a large number of applications and functions. 

4.2 Directory tree

.--appname

|   |--inc

|   |   |--functions.inc.php

|   |   |--header.inc.php

|   |   |--hook_preferences.ini.php

|   |   |--hook_home.inc.php

|   |   `--footer.inc.php

|   |--manual

|   |--setup

|   |   |--tables_baseline.inc.php

|   |   |--tables_current.inc.php

|   |   |--tables_update.inc.php

|   |   |--setup.inc.php

|   `--templates

           |--home.gif

           `--preferences.gif

   `--themes

      `--default.theme

4.3 Translations

The translations are now being done thru the database, and
will be configurable to use other mechanisms. 

The application, developer_tools, provides developers/translators
a nice GUI for building and updating translations. 

5 The API

5.1 Introduction

eGroupWare attempts to provide developers with a useful API
to handle common tasks. 

To do this we have created a multi-dimensional class $GLOBALS['phpgw']. 

This allows for terrific code organization, and help developers
easily identify the file that the function is in. All the
files that are part of this class are in the inc/core directory
and are named to match the sub-class. 

Example: $GLOBALS['phpgw']->send->msg() is in the inc/phpgwapi/phpgw_send.inc.php
file. 

5.2 Basic functions

 $GLOBALS['phpgw']->link

$GLOBALS['phpgw']->link($url)
 Add support for session management. ALL links must use this,
that includes href's form actions and header location's. 

If you are just doing a form action back to the same page,
you can use it without any parameters. 

This function is right at the core of the class because it
is used so often, we wanted to save developers a few keystrokes.
Example: 

5.3 Application Functions

 $GLOBALS['phpgw']->common->phpgw_header();

$GLOBALS['phpgw']->phpgw_header()
 Print out the start of the HTML page, including the navigation
bar and includes appname/inc/header.php 

 $GLOBALS['phpgw']->common->phpgw_footer();

$GLOBALS['phpgw']->phpgw_footer()
 Prints the system footer, and includes appname/inc/footer.php 

 $GLOBALS['phpgw']->common->appsession();

$GLOBALS['phpgw']->common->appsession($data)
 Store important information session information that your
application needs.
 $GLOBALS['phpgw']->appsession will return the value of your
session data is you leave the parameter empty [i.e. $GLOBALS['phpgw']->appsession("")],
otherwise it will store whatever data you send to it.
 You can also store a comma delimited string and use explode()
to turn it back into an array when you receive the value
back. 

Example: 

5.4 File functions

 Please also see the phpgwapi/doc/vfs directory for additional
  VFS class documentation

 $GLOBALS['phpgw']->vfs->read_file

$GLOBALS['phpgw']->vfs->read_file($file)
 Returns the data from $file.
 You must send the complete path to the file.
 Example: 

 $GLOBALS['phpgw']->vfs->write_file

$GLOBALS['phpgw']->vfs->write_file($file, $contents)
 Write data to $file.
 You must send the complete path to the file.
 Example: 

 $GLOBALS['phpgw']->vfs->read_userfile

$GLOBALS['phpgw']->vfs->read_userfile($file)
 Returns the data from $file, which resides in the users
private dir.
 Example: 

 $GLOBALS['phpgw']->vfs->write_userfile

$GLOBALS['phpgw']->write_userfile($file, $contents)
 Writes data to $file, which resides in the users private
dir.
 Example: 

 $GLOBALS['phpgw']->vfs->list_userfiles

$GLOBALS['phpgw']->vfs->list_userfiles()
 Returns an array which has the list of files in the users
private dir.
 Example: 

5.5 Email/NNTP Functions

 $GLOBALS['phpgw']->send->msg

$GLOBALS['phpgw']->send->msg($service, $to, $subject, $body,
$msgtype, $cc, $bcc)
 Send a message via email or NNTP and returns any error codes.
 Example: 

6 Configuration Variables

6.1 Introduction

eGroupWare attempts to provide developers with as much information
about the user, group, server, and application configuration
as possible. 

To do this we provide a multi-dimensional array called '$GLOBALS['phpgw_info'][]',
which includes all the information about your environment. 

Due to the multi-dimensional array approach. getting these
values is easy. 

Here are some examples: 

6.2 User information

= Selected theme 

$GLOBALS['phpgw_info']["user"]["private_dir"]
= Users private dir. Use eGroupWare core functions for access
to the files. 

$GLOBALS['phpgw_info']["user"]["firstname"]
= Users first name 

$GLOBALS['phpgw_info']["user"]["lastname"]
= Users last name 

$GLOBALS['phpgw_info']["user"]["fullname"]

7 Using Language Support

7.1 Overview

eGroupWare is built using a multi-language support scheme.
This means the pages can be translated to other languages
very easily. Translations of text strings are stored in
the phpGroupWare database, and can be modified by the eGroupWare
administrator.

Please see the setup/doc directory for a document which contains
more complete documentation of the language system.

7.2 How to use lang support

The lang() function is your application's interface to eGroupWare's
internationalization support.

While developing your application, just wrap all your text
output with calls to lang(), as in the following code: This
will attempt to translate "The
counter is %1", and return a translated version
based on the current application and language in use. Note
how the position that $x will end up is controlled by the
format string, not by building up the string in your code.
This allows your application to be translated to languages
where the actual number is not placed at the end of the
string.

When a translation is not found, the original text will be
returned with a * after the string. This makes it easy to
develop your application, then go back and add missing translations
(identified by the *) later.

Without a specific translation in the lang table, the above
code will print:  If the current user speaks Italian, they
string returned may instead be: 

 The lang function



$key  

  is the string to translate and may contain replacement
  directives of the form %n.
  

$m1  

  is the first replacement value or may be an array of replacement
  values (in which case $m2 and above are ignored).

$m2 - $m10  

  the 2nd through 10th replacement values if $m1 is not an
  array.

The database is searched for rows with a lang.message_id
that matches $key. If a translation is not found, the original
$key is used. The translation engine then replaces all tokens
of the form %N with the Nth parameter (either $m1[N] or
$mN). 

 Adding translation data

An application called Transy is being developed to make this
easier, until then you can create the translation data manually. 

 The lang table

The translation class uses the lang table for all translations.
We are concerned with 4 of the columns to create a translation: 

message_id  

  The key to identify the message (the $key passed to the
  lang() function). This is written in English.

app_name  

  The application the translation applies to, or common if
  it is common across multiple applications.

lang  

  The code for the language the translation is in.

content  

  The translated string.

7.3 Common return codes

If you browse through the eGroupWare sources, you may notice
a pattern to the return codes used in the higher-level functions.
The codes used are partially documented in the doc/developers/CODES
file.

Codes are used as a simple way to communicate common error
and progress conditions back to the user. They are mapped
to a text string through the check_code() function, which
passes the strings through lang() before returning.

For example, calling Would print  translated into the current
language.

8 Using Templates

8.1 Overview

eGroupWare is built using a templates-based design. This
means the display pages, stored in tpl files, can be translated
to other languages, made to look completely different. 

8.2 How to use templates

Some instructions on using templates: 

For Further info read the PHPLIBs documentation for their
template class. [http://phplib.netuse.de]
