1) Format your code so that we can read it. Please!
2) Use tabs for formating. NOT SPACES. Tabs creates smaller files and editors allow developers to view a tab as however many spaces as they prefer. Spaces do not allow this.
3) Use ' instead of " for strings. This is a performance issue, and prevents alot of inconsistant coding styles.
4) Comments go on the line ABOVE the code. NOT to the left of the code!
5) For each section of code put a section divider with basic explaination of the following code/functions.
It should look like this:
/****************************************************************************\
* These functions are used to pick my nose                                   *
\****************************************************************************/

6) Do not document every bit of code in comments. PHP is an interpreted language and it will be nasty on performance

7) Use switch statements where many elseif's are going to be used. Switch is faster and I like it better!
8) If statement formats
Choice 1:
if ($var == 'example'){
	echo 'This is only an example';
}else{
	echo 'This is not a test. This is the real thing';
}

Choice 2:
if ($var == 'example'){ echo 'An example'; }

(I prefer that choice 2 should not be used when there is an else involved.)
All other styles are not to be used. This is it. Use it or I will personally come and nag you to death.


9) class/function format
class testing 
{
	function print_to_screen() {
		global phpgw, phpgw_info;
		if ($var == 'example'){
			echo 'This is only an example';
		}else{
			echo 'This is not a test. This is the real thing';
		}
	}
}

Notice that when defining a class we break from the norm (putting } on same line as statement) and move the { to the next line. Dont ask me why, but this is what I/we do.

This is all I have got for now.
