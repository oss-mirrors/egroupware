1) Format your code so that we can read it. Please!
2) Use tabs for formating. NOT SPACES. Tabs creates smaller files and editors allow
	developers to view a tab as however many spaces as they prefer. Spaces do not allow this.
3) Use ' instead of " for strings. This is a performance issue, and prevents alot of inconsistant
	coding styles.
4) Comments go on the line ABOVE the code. NOT to the right of the code!
5) For each section of code put a section divider with basic explaination of the following
	code/functions.

It should look like this:
	/****************************************************************************\
	* These functions are used to pick my nose                                   *
	\****************************************************************************/

6) Do not document every bit of code in comments. PHP is an interpreted language and it will be
	nasty on performance

7) Use switch statements where many elseif's are going to be used. Switch is faster and I like it
	better!
8) If statement need to follow the following format

	if ($var == 'example')
	{
		echo 'This is only an example';
	}
	else
	{
		echo 'This is not a test. This is the real thing';
	}

	Do NOT make if statements like this
	if ($var == 'example'){ echo 'An example'; }

All other styles are not to be used. This is it. Use it or I will personally come and nag you to
death.

9) ALL if statements HAVE to have match { }
   Do NOT create if statements like this:
   if ($a == b)
   	dosomething();
   or:
   if ($a == b) dosomething();

	They make the code more difficault to read and follow

10) class/function format
	class testing 
	{
		function print_to_screen()
		{
			global phpgw, phpgw_info;

			if ($var == 'example')
			{
				echo 'This is only an example';
			}
			else
			{
				echo 'This is not a test. This is the real thing';
			}
		}
	}

Notice that when defining a class we break from the norm (putting } on same line as statement) and move the { to the next line. Dont ask me why, but this is what I/we do.

11) Arrays must be written in the following way
	$array = array(
		'var'  => 'value',
		'var2' => 'value2'
	);

	Spaces are permitied between the => 's

12) Use the long format for <?php do NOT use <?
13) All code should start with 1 tab  example:

<?php
	dosomething();
	if ($a)
	{
		dosomemorestuff();
	}

NOT

<?php
dosomething();
if ($a)
{
	dosomemorestuff();
}

14) Use lower case for variable and function names.  No stubly case code
