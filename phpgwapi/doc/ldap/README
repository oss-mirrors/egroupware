eGroupWare needs no more special LDAP schemas since version 1.3.007:

- valid eGroupWare users have a posixAccount and shadowAccount object class.
- valid Groups have a posixGroup object class and store there members in the memberuid attribute.

If you want to use group-addressbooks in LDAP, the ACL requires that groups get expanded by the LDAP server.
To do so, we need to use groupOfNames together with posixGroup (groupOfNames stores the dn in the member
attribute, posixGroup only the uid in the memberUid attribute).
If your LDAP uses the original nis.schema, posixGroup is a structural object and can NOT be used together!
Newer SuSE distributions use a rfc2307bis schema, which can be used on other distributions too
(instead of the nis.schema, NOT together). The schema is in the same directory as this README.

To change to the rfc2307bis.schema (not needed with newer SuSE distros!):
----------------------------------
- create an ldif from your ldap: slapcat > my.ldif
- add objectclass groupOfNames to every group (only the groups!)
- change every occurence of "structuralObjectClass: posixGroup" to "structuralObjectClass: groupOfNames"
- edit your slapd.conf:
  + remove the include of the nis.schema
  + include the rfc2307bis.schema in this dir
- stoping ldap
- empty the ldap database (eg. by removing the content of /var/lib/ldap)
- add the edited ldif file
- start ldap again

eGroupWare detects if it can use groupOfNames together with posixGroup and fills the member attribute,
if you edit the group or changes the members.

To create a dedicated LDAP account for eGroupWare, you can use the following sample LDIF:
cn=eGroupWare,dc=domain,dc=com
cn: eGroupWare
objectClass: person
sn: eGroupWare
userPassword: SOME_LONG_RANDOM_PASSWORD

To give eGroupWare permission to manage the groups, you can use the following ACL:
	access to dn.subtree="ou=groups,dc=domain,dc=com"
		by dn="cn=eGroupWare,dc=domain,dc=com" write
