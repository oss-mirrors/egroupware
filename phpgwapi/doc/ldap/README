THESE FILES ARE NOT YET REQUIRED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THIS IS STILL FOR FUTURE USE ONLY AND IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

This directory contains schema files for use the with various
LDAP servers to which we have access.  Openldap 1.X is very
forgiving, and it is not required to load this schema in all
cases.  Openldap 2.X is less forgiving and requires schema
definitions for all objectclasses and attributes.

Openldap 1.X:

The following are for use with openldap 1.X:
	phpgw.oc.conf	defines the phpgwAccount objectclass
	phpgw.at.conf	defines our special attributes

They should be copied to /etc/openldap and added to
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf:

include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.oc.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.at.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgwcontact.oc.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgwcontact.at.conf


Openldap 2.X, possibly others:

The following are for use with openldap 2.X:
	phpgwaccount.schema		defines the phpgwAccount objectclass and our attributes
	phpgwcontact.schema		defines the phpgwContact objectclass and our attributes

These should be copied to /etc/openldap/schema and added to
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf:

include		/etc/openldap/schema/phpgwaccount.schema
include		/etc/openldap/schema/phpgwcontact.schema
