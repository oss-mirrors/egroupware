Openldap 1.X:

The following are for use with openldap 1.X:
	phpgw.oc.conf	defines the phpgwAccount objectclass
	phpgw.at.conf	defines our special attributes

They should be copied to /etc/openldap and added to
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf:

include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.oc.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.at.conf


Openldap 2.X, possibly others:

The following is for use with openldap 2.X.  It should load, but the
OID values are arbitrarily chosen for testing.  We have applied for
an OID that we can use.  Once that has been issued, we will update
this file:
	phpgwaccount.schema	defines the phpgwAccount objectclass and our attributes

This should be copied to /etc/openldap/schema and added to
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf:

include		/etc/openldap/schema/phpgwaccount.schema
