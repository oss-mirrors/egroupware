<P>These are two functions you'll need to know before we get into relativity.</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec:path_parts"></A> <A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="vfs.html#toc3.1">path_parts ()</A>
</H2>

<P>The job of path_parts () is to translate any given file location into its
many component parts for any relativity. The prototype for path_parts () is:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
function path_parts ($string, $relatives = array (RELATIVE_CURRENT), $object = True)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>$string is the path you want to translate, $relatives is
the standard relativity array, and $object specifies how you would like
the return value: if $object is True, an object will be returned; if
$object is False, an array will be returned. I think you'll find the
object easier to deal with, and we'll be using it throughout this document.
The most important returned values (but not all) for path_parts () are:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
fake_full_path
fake_leading_dirs
fake_extra_path
fake_name
real_full_path
real_leading_dirs
real_extra_path
real_name
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Just like you would think, fake_full_path contains the full virtual path
of $string, and real_full_path contains the full real path of $string.
The fake_name and real_name variables should always be the same, and contain
the final file or directory name. The leading_dirs contain everything except
the name, and the extra_path is everything from the / before "home" to the end
of the leading_dirs. To better illustrate, here is an example:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$p = $phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;path_parts ("/home/jason/dir/file", array (RELATIVE_NONE));
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>$p-&gt;fake_full_path - /home/jason/dir/file</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;fake_leading_dirs - /home/jason/dir</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;fake_extra_path - home/jason/dir</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;fake_name - file</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;real_full_path - /var/www/phpgroupware/files/home/jason/dir/file</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;real_leading_dirs - /var/www/phpgroupware/files/home/jason/dir
 </LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;real_extra_path - home/jason/dir</LI>
<LI>$p-&gt;real_name - file</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>As you can see, path_parts () is a very useful function and will save you
from doing those darn substr ()'s yourself. For those of you used to the prior
VFS, note that <EM>getabsolutepath () is depreciated</EM>. getabsolutepath () still
exists (albeit in a much different form), and is responsible for some of the
path translation, but it is an <EM>internal</EM> function only. Applications should
only use path_parts (). We have shown you how to use path_parts () so you can
experiment with it using different paths and relativities as we explore relativity.</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec:cd"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="vfs.html#toc3.2">cd ()</A>
</H2>

<P>Part of the overall goal for the VFS in phpGroupWare is to give the user
a seamless experience during their session. For example, if they upload a file
using a file manager to /home/my_group/project1, and then go to download an
email attachment, the default directory will be /home/my_group/project1. This
is accomplished using the cd () function. The prototype and examples: </P>
<P>
<PRE>
function cd ($target = &quot;/&quot;, $relative = True, $relatives = array (RELATIVE_CURRENT))
$phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;cd ("/");     /* cd to their home directory */
$phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;cd ("/home/jason/dir", False, array (RELATIVE_NONE)); /* cd to /home/jason/dir */
$phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;cd ("dir2", True); /* When following the above, cd's to /home/jason/dir/dir2 */
</PRE>
</P>
<P>If $relatives is True, the $target is simply appended to
the current path. If you want to know what the current path is, use $phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;pwd
().</P>
<P>Now you're ready for relativity.</P>
