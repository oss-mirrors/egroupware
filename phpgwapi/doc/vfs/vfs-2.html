<P>You must explicitly enable the VFS class. To do this, set "enable_vfs_class"
to True in $phpgw_info[&quot;flags&quot;]. An example:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$phpgw_info[&quot;flags&quot;] = array(&quot;currentapp&quot; =&gt; &quot;phpwebhosting&quot;,
&quot;noheader&quot; =&gt; False,
&quot;noappheader&quot; =&gt; False,
&quot;enable_vfs_class&quot; =&gt; True,
&quot;enable_browser_class&quot; =&gt; True);
</PRE>

</H2>

<P>The VFS in located in phpgwapi/inc/class.vfs.inc.php. You can look over
it, but I don't suggest trying to understand how it works. It isn't necessary
to know its internals to use it, but you may find the inline comments helpful.
The basic things to keep in mind:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Files and directories are synonymous in almost all cases</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;mv ("file1", "dir/file2");
$phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;mv ("dir1", "dir/dir1");
$phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;rm ("file");
$phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;rm ("dir");
</PRE>
</P>
<P>All work as you would except them to. The major exception is:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;touch ("file");
</PRE>
</P>
<P>vs.</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;mkdir ("dir");
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Users and groups and synonymous</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>As far as the actual paths are concerned, users and groups are the same.
The VFS has no built in ACL support, so /home/username works the same as /home/groupname.
See the note on ACL support in the Notes section.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You should never have to know the real path of files</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>One of the VFS's responsibilities is to translate paths for you. While
you certainly <EM>can</EM> operate using full paths, it is much simpler to use the virtual
paths. For example, instead of using:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;cp ("/var/www/phpgroupware/files/home/user/file1", "/var/www/phpgroupware/files/home/user/file2", array (RELATIVE_NONE|VFS_REAL, RELATIVE_NONE|VFS_REAL));
</PRE>
</P>
<P>you might use</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$phpgw-&gt;vfs-&gt;cp ("/home/user/file1", "/home/user/file2", array (RELATIVE_NONE, RELATIVE_NONE));
</PRE>
</P>
<P>(We'll get to the RELATIVE's in a minute.)</P>
<P>Site administrators should be able to move their files dir around on their
system and know that everything will continue to work smoothly.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Relativity is <EM>vital</EM></LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Relativity is a new feature in the VFS, and its importance cannot be stressed
enough. It will make your life much easier, especially for file system intensive
applications, but it will take some getting used to. If something doesn't work
right the first time, chances are great it has to do with incorrect relativity
settings. We will deal with relativity in depth in the Relativity section.</P>
