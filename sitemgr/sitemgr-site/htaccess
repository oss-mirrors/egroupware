# If you want your URLs to look like this:
#   http://mymachine.com/page1/
# instead of like this:
#   http://mymachine.com/index.php?page_name=page1
# and you're running Apache, then customize and add
# the below line to your .htaccess file, or
# copy this file to .htaccess.  Note that your
# Apache web server needs to be setup to read
# .htaccess files and allow use of the ErrorDocument
# directive.  If it doesn't work for you, don't
# start asking me questions about it....
# 
# The other thing you need to do is to edit the
# relocate.php file's top two lines.  
#
# Also, if you want your links to be pretty, change
# the htaccess_404 link in config.inc.php to 'enabled'
# from 'disabled'.
