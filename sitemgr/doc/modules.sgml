<articleinfo><title>Introduction to sitemgr modules</title><date>January 1, 2003</date><author><firstname>Michael</firstname> <surname>Totschnig</surname></author><abstract><para>This text provides an overview of sitemgr's proposed new modularized architecture and contains the information users, administrators, template designers and application devellopers need in order to get started using sitemgr as a flexible web site managment system that can easily make any information and business logic phpgroupware knows about publicly accessible. This text also serves as a request for comments, so that sitemgr's new generation can be adapted quickly to the needs of PHPgroupware's user community. Please be aware that at the moment the new sitemgr is still experimental and that there are some areas of its functionnality that need further developpment.</para></abstract></articleinfo>
<sect1><title>Introduction</title><para>For the next generaton of phpgroupware's web site managment application sitemgr, we propose a new page generation architecture whose fundamental idea is that all dynamic web site content is built by modules. In this section, I will sketch a short outline of how this architecture works and I will present the concepts it makes use of.</para><sect2><title>Template</title><para>Sitemgr builds web sites from templates. Those are stored in the directory sitemgr/sitemg-site/templates. Each of them has a directory of its own. The file main.tpl defines the template of the whole site, there can be other files that define code for separate areas of the page or for specific modules. Templates contain four kinds of variables. These are explained here since the types 2,3 and 4 can be used both in the template as in the page content a module generates.</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>&lcub;contentarea: areaname&rcub; These define where administrator and contributor provided content go. The names and the number of contentareas a template defines are almost arbitrary.</para></listitem><listitem><para>&lcub;appname.modulename(?arguments)&rcub;These let you hardcode a call to a module into a template. Arguments are in the HTTP GET query string syntax (?key1=value1&amp;key2=value2). At the moment, if you use this type of variables, you have to urlencode the query string yourself. Future versions of sitemgr might provide a simpler notation. For example,&lcub;sitemgr.lang_block&rsqb; creates the select box for multilingual sites.</para></listitem><listitem><para>&lcub;?(phpgw|sitemgr:)link&rcub; This lets you create links either to other pages of your website, or to phpgroupware applications:</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>Links to sitemgr either start with '?sitemgr:' or only with '?'. You can either link to a page with &lcub;?page_name=downloads&rsqb; and &lsqb;?page_id=4&rcub;, to a category's index (?category_id=5), to the site index (?index), to the site's table of contents (?toc). Just &lsqb;?&rsqb; or &lcub;?sitemgr:&rcub; links to the administrator defined home page.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Links to phpgw start with '?phpgw:' . You have to name the application followed by a comma, and optionnally arguments the application can interpret. For example &lcub;?phpgw:/addressbook,order=n_given&amp;sort=ASC&rcub;.</para></listitem></orderedlist></listitem><listitem><para>&lcub;variable&rcub; Finally there are some simple variables you can use to retrieve metainformation about the page or about the user's context:</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>&lcub;title&rcub; the page title</para></listitem><listitem><para>&lcub;subtitle&rcub; the page subtitle</para></listitem><listitem><para>&lcub;sitename&rcub;the sitename the administrator has chosen for the site</para></listitem><listitem><para>&lcub;footer&rcub;the administrator edited footer</para></listitem><listitem><para>&lcub;header&rcub;the administrator edited header</para></listitem><listitem><para>&lcub;user&rcub;the user's account name</para></listitem></orderedlist></listitem></orderedlist></sect2>
<sect2><title>Module</title><para>The main function of a sitemgr module is to generate dynamic web site content. To make the development of new modules, and the use of modules easy and convenient, sitemgr defines an &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; class module which each module should extend. This parent of all modules, provides one essential service: It hooks the module into the content managment interface and permits the editing of the module's arguments that determine what content will be generated. Thus in order to create a new module, all you have to do, is to extend the abstract super module, define the modules arguments, and write a get_content function that returns the content that should be displayed on the website. More on this in chapter<link linkend="Application-developper-manual">5</link>.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>Argument/Content</title><para>A module can be seen as a transformation of input arguments into generated content. It is important to understand that the input arguments can be of completely different kinds. On the one hand there can be arguments that are as close as possible to the generated content. For example the html module's only argument is named &ldquo;htmlcontent&rdquo; and in normal circumstances it is not transformed at all but handed over as is to the page generation engine. On the other hand arguments can play any conceivable role in the generation of content that is driven by data coming from other phpgroupware applications. They can be used to select between different categories of content, they can choose a certain format of presentation, they can function as search terms, etc.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>Properties</title><para>A module can define properties. Properties are accessible to the modules get_content function in the same way as arguments, but they differ from them in two ways:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Properties are edited by the site administrator. Their intended role is to put certain constrains on the workings of the module, so that a site administrator can enforce certain rules. For example the standard html module defines a property called striphtml. If this boolean property is set the module replaces all html in the generated content with entities.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Properties are not defined with respect to a certain generated content block, but are defined either on a site-wide level or on the level of specific categories. Additionally you can differenciate on each scope properties for each content area. When a content block is generated, properties are searched for in a cascading way, i.e. when the block is specific to a specific page and contentarea and the module's properties are not defined for the combination of the contentarea and the page's category, then properties defined for higher scopes are looked for in a certain order. More on this in chapter<link linkend="Administrator-manual">3</link>.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></sect2>
<sect2><title>Blocks, content areas and scope</title><para>There are three ways a module can generate content that will be displayed on a web page:</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>A template can contain hardcoded calls to modules that will generate content visible on each page. Thus you could put dynamic content that is visible across the whole site on a place of its own directly into the template. But beware that restrictions defined by the administrator also apply to these hardcoded module calls.</para></listitem><listitem><para>A template defines several content areas. This is one important differenced between the modularized sitemgr and previous versions where there were was only one place where contributor edited content went (page_content) and two places for administrator configured blocks (right_blocks, left_blocks). Now templates can define any practical number of content areas with arbitrary names. And there is no more much difference between central and peripheric areas. All can show administrator and contributor provided block content.With one exeption: The name &ldquo;center&rdquo; is special in that special pages that get generated by special URLs like &ldquo;?toc&rdquo; and &ldquo;?index&rdquo; or &ldquo;?category_id=number&rdquo; always put there page content (which is internally generated by nothing else than a module) into this content area. If your template does not have a content area called &ldquo;center&rdquo; these special URLs won't work.
Content areas can display module output, as edited by the page's contributors. We refer to each output of a module as a block. Here is another important difference to how sitemgr used to work: Until now there was a sharp distinction between page content which replaces the template variable page_content, and side blocks which got defined in a special file called blockconfig and replaced the template varialbes right_blocks and left_blocks. Now from the perspective of the page generation engine there is no more any difference between content areas, all display blocks of content generated by modules.
The blocks one content area displays can be defined on different levels of scope: There are site wide blocks that are visible across the whole site, category wide blocks, that are visible on pages that belong to the category or any of its children, and finally are page blocks that define what distinguishes the page from other pages, and normally will be that what you'd call the page's main content.</para></listitem><listitem><para>The block content generated by a module can contain template variables of the same type as those that can be hardcoded. This is mostly useful for modules like the html module, where the contributor specified argument is nearly identical to the generated content. Thus a contributor can embed module calls inside the content of a certain block. This is done only once without any recursion, i.e. if a embedded module call returns itself a template variable it is not parsed and processed again.</para></listitem></orderedlist></sect2>
<sect2><title>Transformer</title><para>The architecture for sitemgr modules provides for the distinction between some form of raw content a module produces and the way it should get displayed on the web site, with the future possibility to plug other display types into the same framework. The idea is that the raw content of a module gets passed through different transformers, possibly even several transformers in a sequence at the time of content generation. Additionally this provides for a use of modules outside of sitemgr, for example remote retrieval of information with something like XML-RPC. </para><para>At the moment, a module does not need to use transformers on its own, it can directly generate html content, but if it does, sitemgr provides for an easy way to chain different transformers together. Thus a module can be constructed in different layers of functionality. For example a module's get_content function could return data inXML, and it defines a XSLT transformation to reorganize this data, and a second transformer for creating a user interface for display.</para><para>Transformers are also used on the level of the site template, insofar as each contentarea can have an associated transformer, which wraps the different content blocks into a common display format. This does the same thing as the file sideblock.tpl in former versions of sitemgr.</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>Translations</title><para>Sitemgr in its new modularized architecture continues to be fully multilingual. It is very simple to have a new module use this feature. All that is needed is to use a special flag in the definition of the module's arguments. All arguments that have this flag will be stored in a language specific database table, and can be translated in the translation manager, very similar to the way category and page definitions could already be translated to several languages.</para></sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1><title>User manual</title><para>The most important difference for site contributors between the modularized sitemgr and its older versions is that in the page manager now there are two different interfaces for each page:</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>When you create a new page or when you click on the Edit button which is associated with an existing page, you no longer edit the page content, but only some basic metainformation about the page as its name, title, subtitle and sort order, and you can change the category the page belongs to.</para></listitem><listitem><para>There is a new interface that gets displayed when you click on a page's &ldquo;Manage content&rdquo; button. It is here that you create the content blocks for each page.</para></listitem></orderedlist><para>The second difference is that now a contributor can also define content blocks for the whole category he has write access for. These category wide blocks will be seen on each page that belongs to the category or to any of its subcategories. There are also side wide content blocks that only the site administrator can create.</para><para>The interface for creating content blocks is the same on each level of scope, besides that when editing blocks on a lower level you can see all the blocks that have been defined on a higher level, and will be displayed on the website together with the blocks you are editing. I will refer to this interface as the content manager.</para><para>In each content manager, there is a section for each content area, where you can add blocks selected from a menu of all available modules. Once you have added a new block, it appears amidst all other blocks of the content area. Those defined on higher level scopes are only displayed, those pertaining to the scope (site-wide, category or page) you are managing are editable. There are four standard interface elements you can edit for each block:</para><variablelist><varlistentry><term>Title
</term><listitem><para>Each module defines a default title for blocks it generates. The block title is not necessarily displayed in each content area. It depends on the block transformer defined for the content area by the site template you use. Here you can override the default title with a customized title that will only be used by the block you are editing.</para></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>Actif
</term><listitem><para>When you create a new block, it is not immediately visible on the web site. This makes sense since you need to edit its arguments first. When you are finished defining a blocks arguments, you have to check the actif flag to make it visible. This can also be practical if you want to hide some content temporarily from the web site without deleting it from the database.</para></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>Seenby
</term><listitem><para>You can control the visibility of each block for the different user roles defined by sitemgr: site administrators, phpgroupware users (which include site administrators) and the anonymous user. Evidently you can also make the block visible for everyone which is the default. </para></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>Sortorder
</term><listitem><para>Here you can change the order in which the blocks are displayed by defining a different integer for each block.</para></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist><para>After these, you have to edit the module specific arguments, each of which is preceded by an explanatory label. The input elements for arguments can be of different types: checkboxes, selectboxes, textareas, textfields. In the case of text input, you can use the same template variables as are used in the site template. But be aware that this only works if the module puts the same variable into its output, which need not necessarily be the case.</para></sect1>

You should also install the sitemgr-link application, which is is inside sitemgr and has to be moved up in the directory hierarchy.</para><programlisting><![CDATA[cd sitemgr
]]><![CDATA[mv sitemgr-link ..
]]></programlisting><para>and then install sitemgr-link with setup</para></listitem><listitem><para>Log in to phpGroupWare as an admin and create an anonymous phpgw user and assign it a password. The only app (I assume) that they should have access to is sitemgr-link. sitemgr-link is a dummy application that redirects phpGW users to the generated site.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Users who you wish to see sitemgr (aka contributors) must be given acces to sitemgr, users who you want to be able to link to the sitemgr site from phpGW must be given rights to sitemgr-link. The easiest way to do this is to go to User groups and give groups permissions to use the applications. </para></listitem><listitem><para>The sitemgr-site is the directory that serves the dynamic web site. It is located inside sitemgr and works without moving it somewhere else. But it can be located anywhere. For example, you could put it in /var/www/html. You could make the root location of your web server point to it, if you wish (ie, http://yourmachine/ refers to /var/www/html/sitemgr-site if you moved the directory, or to /path/to/phpgroupware/sitemgr/sitemgr-site if you did not). Make a mental note of the directory where you put it and the url that it is accessed by.</para></listitem><listitem><para>In the sitemgr-site directory is a file called config.inc.php. You only have to edit it if you moved the directory. Change the value of the line</para><programlisting><![CDATA['phpgw_path'           => '../../',
]]></programlisting><para>so that the value of &dollar;sitemgr_info&lsqb;'phpgw_path'&rsqb; is '/path/to/phpgroupware/'</para></listitem><listitem><para>You're almost set to go. Log in to phpGroupWare as an adminis trator. Make sure you gave yourself the sitemgr and sitemgr-link applications so that you see them on your navbar. Go to the sitemgr application and select &quot;Configure SiteMgr&quot;. Fill in &ldquo;URL to sitemgr-site&rdquo; and &ldquo;Filesystem path to sitemgr-site directory&rdquo;, and the anonymous user's name and password. Then click on save, and you should know select the template for your site.</para></listitem><listitem><para>That's it. Go to the Category manager, add a category or three and check who can view and edit them, then go to the page manager, add a page or three to each category, set up your site header, site footer, etc., and go view your recently created site by clicking on the sitemgr-link application. Voilà!</para></listitem></orderedlist></sect2>
<sect2><title>Maintenance</title><para>As a site administrator, you have three privileges/responsibilies:</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>Define site wide content blocks. These are edited in the same interface as category and page specific blocks.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Choose permitted modules: If you choose &ldquo;Manage site-wide module properties&rdquo; from sitemgr's main menu, you will see several rows which all contain four elements: a select box, a button labelled &ldquo;Select allowed modules', another select box and a button labelled &ldquo;Configure module properties&rdquo;. The first select box and its adjacent button in each row permits to choose lists of permitted modules. The first row defines a master list for the whole site which is used when no more specific lists are found for content areas or categories. The following rows each pertain to the different content areas of your site template. Here you can choose to allow some modules for one content areas, and other modules for another one.
In the category manager, there is a button &ldquo;Manage Modules&rdquo; associated with each category. There you can use the same interface to define lists specific to one category (and all its subcategories, unless overriden). Again you have the choice between one list that pertains to all content areas, and specific lists for each category.
When sitemgr has to find a specific value of permitted lists in a given context (a given contentarea in a given category) the following algorithm is used: First it aks for a value defined for the pair contentarea/category. If none is defined, it climbs up the category hierarchy until the site wide value, each time looking for a value defined for the pair contentarea/category. If none can be found, it returns to the given category the search started from, and now asks for values defined for the given category but independent from the contentarea. If there is still none defined, it repeats the same traversal up the category hierarchy. This means that by simply defining one global master list of permitted modules, you can configure the whole site, if you do not need more fine grained control.
The lists of permitted lists are never merged, if you define one list for a given context, this list is used in this context.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Define module properties: The lookup algorithm for module properties is exactly the same as for the lists of permitted modules. For each module you can set properties for the whole site, for content areas, for categories, or for combinations of content areas and categories. You access the property editor from the same page where you choose the list of permitted modules. You just use the second select box in each row. By selecting one module and clicking the &ldquo;Configure module properties&rdquo; button, you will open a interface for editing the module's properties which ressembles the interface for editing module arguments in the content manager. Be aware that only some modules define properties.</para></listitem></orderedlist></sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1><title>Template designer manual<anchor id="Template-designer-manual"></title><para>One main idea behind sitemgr's modularized architecture is that all dynamic content on the website is produced by a module. This permits for a very structural way of defining functionality and for an easy way of extending functionality. With respect to former versions of sitemgr, this means that the templates have to be slightly modified:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>The whole page template is now stored in a file main.tpl in the template's directory.</para></listitem><listitem><para>The variables page_content, left_blocks,right_blocks have to be replaced by content areas: &lcub;contentarea:center&rcub;, &lcub;contentarea:left&rcub;, &lcub;contentarea:right&rcub;. Only the contentarea center has a special semantics, since it is the hardcoded value for the display of table of contents and side index. All other contentareas can have arbitrary names, and you can have any practical number of them.</para></listitem><listitem><para>A contentarea serves to display the content blocks, the site administrator and contributors define. Each contentarea can have its own way of wrapping html code around each content block. This at the moment defined in a class that implements the transformer interface, i.e. defines a function apply_transform(&dollar;title,&dollar;content).This class' name is areaname_bt (for blocktransformer) and it is stored in file areaname_bt.inc.php inside the template directory. The function apply_transform just has to wrap the desired html around the content. It is free to ignore the title, for example the block title does not necessarily make sense in a page's central content area. A block transformer could apply other transformations to the content, but this would probably have counter-intuitive effects on your page's contributors.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Other than that a template directory can contain template files that are specific to a certain module. For example the news module uses a file newsblock.tpl which is a standard API template. It is up to a module's developpers what kind of templates he wants to use. We propose to use a namespace for these module specific template files. For example a template used by module 'news_admin.news' would go into a subdirectory 'news_admin/news' in each template directory. If the module does not find a template it needs in the site template's directory, it should look for a default template file, for example in &ldquo;default/news_admin/news'.</para></listitem><listitem><para>You can hardcode module calls into the template if your site should have the same dynamic content on one specific place.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></sect1>
<sect1><title>Application developper manual<anchor id="Application-developper-manual"></title><para>Sitemgr's parent module class, defines all the important functionality a module needs in its lifetime. Thus creating a new module can be as easy as creating a class that extends the standard module, defines the module's arguments if there are any, and has a function get_content that produces the module's content. Let's start with &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;.</para><programlisting><![CDATA[<?php

Easy, isn't it?</para><para>Now let's examine more in detail how the standard module is constructed. This will help you understand in what way you can extend it to create more powerful modules. It defines the following functions:</para><variablelist><varlistentry><term>add_transformer(&dollar;transformer)
</term><listitem><para>This function adds a transformer class to the module's transformer chain, so that when a block is generated from this module, its content will be passed through &dollar;transformer. This function is automatically called for block transformers, but you can use it on your own, if you want to separate in your module raw content from different forms of output. There is only one function a transformer class has to provide:</para><variablelist><varlistentry><term>apply_transform(&dollar;title,&dollar;content)
</term><listitem><para>A transformer that is not a block transformer should normally ignore the title argument, and construct its return value from the content argument.</para></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>set_block(&dollar;block,&dollar;produce=False)

If your module overrides this function, it should always call the parent class' set_block function first with parent::set_block(&dollar;block). If you want to configure your module with respect to the block, you can do this here. This is also the place where your module should add the transformers it needs for generating output. For example:</para></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist><programlisting><![CDATA[function set_block($block)

</term><listitem><para>This function is responsible for creating the interface you use in the content manager when you edit a module's arguments. If you want this interface to show more than your module's arguments, youcan override this function. It must return an array of interface elements where each element is an array with two values associated to the keys label and form. You can even dynamically construct arguments, sitemgr's sample gallery module shows how to do this.</para></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>get_admin_interface(&dollar;defaults)

</term><listitem><para>This function is called when a module's arguments are edited. The parent class simply returns true. When you override this function, you can alter the arguments, a reference to which is passed to the function, but you can also return false, and set the module's validation_error variable. In this case, the arguments will not be saved and the validation error is displayed to the user. For example we could add the following lines to our hello module:</para><programlisting><![CDATA[function validate(&$data)

</term><listitem><para>This is the function every module needs. It produces the module's content. It is passed two arrays, one with the arguments for the block the module is generating, and the other with the properties that apply for the block's context. At the moment there is no constraint on what type of date the get_content function returns. It can be html, xml, an array, etc. But if it does not return html, you have to provide a transformer capable to produce html from the data get_content produces. The arguments are passed as a reference, because the get_content function can change them, and they can get stored automatically as session variable. This is because the parent module provides one other service: Your module can rely on an automatic handling of HTTP GET, POST and COOKIE variables, and of session variables. All you'd have to do is to define the arrays &dollar;this-&gt;get, &dollar;this-&gt;post, &dollar;this-&gt;cookie and &dollar;this-&gt;session. All members of these variables will be fetched from the GET, POST or COOKIE parameters, or from session variables and stored for you in the &dollar;arguments array. The entries of &dollar;this-&gt;session additionnaly will be stored after get_content returns to get_output. This can be very useful if you want your module do remain in a stable state while the user interacts with other modules on the same page.</para><para>The variables you define in these arrays can be identical to those in &dollar;this-&gt;arguments. In this case, if they are defined in the HTTP session context, they will override the values the page contributor has defined for the page. But they can be different variables that do not need an initial value provided by the page contributor. Whereas &dollar;this-&gt;get,&dollar;this-&gt;cookie and &dollar;this-&gt;session are simple arrays enumerating the variable names, &dollar;this-&gt;post is special because it can contain the element definition in the same way as &dollar;this-&gt;arguments, which can be used to programatically construct the form elements.</para><para>Your module does not need to use this service, it could directly read HTTP variables. The advantage of using it is that it provides a namespace for each module, so that if you use different modules on the same page, that use the same variable names, you would not run into problems. If you use this service you can construct URLS automatically with the modules link function (see below), and if you construct the user interface, you have to provide the correct form element names for this service to work. The build_post_element function can help you do this. For example lets extend our hello module, so that the site user can choose his own name. Since we can no longer rely on the validation that is automatically done on contributor provided input. we call validate from the get_content function.</para><programlisting><![CDATA[<?php
