	the backup application currently works for local mysql -,
	pgsql - and ldap - databases plus for the users imap
	Maildirs.
	it does not work to create backup archives from remote
	databases.
	the archives can be stored either locally or can be moved
	to a remote host via ftp or smbmount.
	if your webserver works with mod_php you have to have
	php installed on your system in addition.

1.	the backup of the sql/ldap/email data will be done by a
	php-script, which is called from a cronjob. to store this
	script you have to create a directory outside of the web-
	servers *document root*. the httpd has to have write access
	to this directory.

2.	the httpd has to have write access to the phpgroupware/backup
	directory.

3.	the configuration part of the backup application can be found
	in the admin part of phpgroupware. after you configured the
	app for your needs you will find 'phpgw_check_for_backup' in
	the backup dir.
	copy this file to the cron.hourly dir,
	chown root.root
	chmod u+x

	this script will copy the backup startscript in the right
	crondir.
