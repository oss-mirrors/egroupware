1.	the backup of the sql/ldap/email data will be done by a
	php-script, which is called from a cronjob. to store this
	script you have to create a directory outside of the web-
	servers *document root*. the httpd has to have write access
	to this directory.

2.	the httpd has to have write access to the phpgroupware/backup
	directory.

3.	the configuration part of the backup application can be found
	in the admin part of phpgroupware. after you configured the
	app for your needs you will find 'phpgw_check_for_backup' in
	the backup dir.
	copy this file to the cron.hourly dir,
	chown root.root
	chmod u+x

	this script will copy the backup startscript in the right
	crondir.
