This directory contains some special versions / adaptations of files from the calendar.

They differ, because:
- the planner is working fully
- infolog is integrated in uicalendar.view
- modifications / corrections on the ACL (still in progress)

I use it to keep track of my changes and be able to sumbit the changes in small patches to skeeter.

If you want to use this version of calendar, simply symlink the files to the coresponding calendar directory.
