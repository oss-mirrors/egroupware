Background
------------
Hi, I'm John Raab aka "Johnny_Vegas" of battlereports.com a cool and interactive gaming
website.  I was getting tired of trying to find a good forum, and knew I could write a decent 
one myself, so I finally did.  And hey why not release it as freeware.  Besides being
a good multi threaded forum, it can also teach you a thing of two about PHP and 
mySQL if you are into that.  Enjoy!

Description and Requirements
----------------------------
VEGAS FORUM 1.0 is a forum written PHP that uses mySQL to store all its data.  It's highly
configurable with a good amount of features.  Your welcome to edit the source code and add
your own cool features if you wish!  To use it you must have PHP 3.0 or higher installed on 
your web server.  Also you must have a web ready mySQL database.  Many web hosts provide this 
software.  The only operating system this has been tested on is the latest version of FreeBSD.  
It should work on other unix servers without change.  Also it should work on NT servers with 
little modification.

Config info
-----------------
The forum needs to be configured before use.  Here are the files needed to run it.

//////////////
forum.php

This is page you need to link to let the web surfers use your forum.
There is one path at the very top of this script that you  need to point to the forumlib.php script.

////////////////
forumadmin.php

This is the admin page that the forum admins go to.  When the admin logs in a cookie gets set 
that will keep them logged in for 1 month before having to relogin.  Also if an admin accidentally
goes to forum.php, they are autoforwarded to forumadmin.php if this cookie is present.  There is a 
link at the top of the forum.php that will take you here.

There is one path at the very top of this script that you need to point to the forumlib.php script

/////////////////
forummain.php

Nothing to configure in this script.  This is used by both forum.php and forumadmin.php, therefore
if you make changes to this script it will affect both the admin and normal user forum views.

/////////////////
forumlib.php

This is the library of functions that the forum uses.  Most of the functionality of the forum is contained
in this file.

You need to set the path to the forumconfig.php script at the top of this script!

///////////////////
forumconfig.php

This very important file is where you set all the configuration parameters for the forum.  You need to 
go through this file and configure your forum before you can use it!  Also you need to create a list of 
admin users which you set at the bottom of this script.  In addition there are 2 mySQL commands you need 
to run, to create database tables that will store your forum data.  These 2 mySQL commands are in forumconfig.php.
